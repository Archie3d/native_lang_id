Legalism actually is fairly similar to modern approaches of governance as it ties into the Weberian idea of a bureaucratic, impartial, strong state that governs fairly rationally and efficiently and so on, this folksy Russian version of having everybody united under some natural and organic Tsar without all the rule of law is completely metaphysical and different.

There's even a law dictating that anything more than two people staging a protest within something like 200 mt can be considered a demonstration.
It kinda is working wonders with Putin, even though he is still in power, from what ive read Russia as a whole has lost alot of economic clout, their savings are greatly diminished and their economy is damaged, this should make to cost of aggressive action greater than what he can gain.
So, fuck them

It’s pretty much how I’d say that
The locals can say whatever they like, doesn't change international recognition, that's all I was pointing out.

Also, he has said on numerous occasions that Russian government should stop supporting the thugs that currently rule Chechnya and stop providing such lavish funding to this region, which is absolutely out of proportion to the funding of other regions and only serves to pacify them and keep them loyal to Putin.

I think there is not a single country I have been to other than maybe Israel where the smoking culture annoys me more.
Opposition journalists are probably safer in the US, but then again the US killed one million Iraqis, destroyed Iraq, helped destroy Libya, and is helping destroy Syria, so comparing Russia to that would be too much.
So you have to ask yourself what will be the price for cheaper gas?
With the most anti-Russia country (incidently, we don't rely like Germany does on Russian energy, coinkidink?) leaving the EU, the EU is going to get more pro-Russia whoever gets elected.
Anyway the flag is remarkable and easy recognizable, it is much better than flags with hackneyed stripes

French accent is straightforward as is Polish and Dutch.
Russia is as responsible as your countries.

Not an EU embassy because they're not s country and each country still has it's own self interests
Then 2008 crisis hit, after that there were two years of pretty good times, but the government started "twisting nuts" and everything went back to shit.
Putinist Russia is also disliked for selectively glorifying both of the regimes.

I'm sure Russian migrants in the US are a different thing than in Estonia.
Russia's going to backstab Trump like it backstabbed Bush & Obama, and then it's going to align even more with China to futhur undermine American Hegemony & the EU-US alliance.

Your point was that "you don't speak it as your native language, it is a foreign language".
The only thing I wanted to illustrate is that if Russia wants to influence the German elections for itself, the logical party to support is the AfD.

People saw Muslims as fighters against the godless atheist Soviets.
China and Russia aren't bogeymen to me.
I kind of, sort of agree about the propaganda, but I'd say there is no conspiracy.

Assuming that Putin and Erdogan are, Yanukovich did not have nearly the control that both of them have.
Nope and Russia (me) is allied to him.
Without the Union our countries will be even more vulnerable to manipulation (US/Russia/China..), and the likelihood for future war will likely increase.
Russia I'm sure is celebrating which always scares me so that's a close second.
We've already heard such claims about Donbass, and after that the "separatist " leaders complained the locals don't want to fight and Russian citizens have to do the job
How about the fact that Golodomor happened not only in the Ukraine, but in what is now southern Russia and Western Kazakhstan?

It's very peaceful here, a lot of mixed families between the Tatars and the Russians
Russia's population basically stagnated for most of the last century

The sum up of Russia based on western news is that Russians are aliens (probably crab people) and they're trying to take over earth.
It does look like 3rd world in some ways
, and they painted the Ukrainian flag wrong, and then misspelled a Ukrainian word in the way a Russian-speaker would ("знищЕН" instead of "знещЕНИЙ", like in Russian "уничтожЕН").
They began to move
Ane even then, would rather expect Russians or Ukrainians.
Even Western pro-Ukrainian reporters travelling from Russia don't bother going through the Ukraine-sanctioned checkpoint because it's so much more expensive and time-consuming to enter Crimea via the mainland vs by air.

It is very inconvenient, because I never know how to address someone and I end up just with "Excuse me, could you ..."
Do not close your eyes, Russia is powerful, it is a threat and economical difficulties will not stop that trend as it never did stop it before.
You know those Swiss bankers, always picking on poor Russia.
It does not have a nuclear deterrent, and did not fall under any other countries nuclear umbrella.
Living in Russia, I wouldn't say so, but that's anecdotal evidence, I guess.
A closer alliance also makes a nuclear war less likely, and that's a good thing in my book.
It has to do something with climate and something with change
Dude we've got enough real problems with Russia, ain't nobody here gonna worry about Germany any time soon...

And the Republic, which is breaking the agreement the country is founded on, threatening with secession, and acting like a Russian puppet is some anti-islamist beacon of hope?
Crimea was Russian just a few decades ago!
This would create a big conflict with the Syrian government and Russia.
I am sure Russia will be thrilled that the GIUK gap is finally open again.
People hear my German accent and instantly assume I'm German, which I am.

No, they won't see her again, until she confessed that on the way to Damascus she saw the light and got the revelation that Crimea was legally Russian since the beginning of times.

He would never organize a refrendum if there was one chance for him to lose it.
I think there are thousands of Russian agents being paid to post on social media throughout the West.
Well, there would be no Russian intervention in Crimea without illegal Western-backed change of power in Kiev and no Russian intervention in Donbass without full-blown civil war that had to be stopped by someone.
It really is mafia state, wikileaks published US diplomatic emails from SPain where they were saying something in the lines of: "You can't tell where operates russian mafia and where russian government" which means that they are so close or even the same thing that you cant tell difference.
Who's fighting whom in the currently active civil war in Ukraine?
Why is 50% of news about Russia now?
Of course the same so called ''western democracies'' that cry about Russian interference are the ones who always interfere in other states, such as sowing coup in Turkey as well as working hard to oust Putin for over 10 years in Russia.
Same comments from many Russia-haters these days.
Is that more of a donut or a fat pancake
I personally am kinda annoyed by it too sometimes, but I can't judge
Russia already has sanctions against it, so it might as well go full nuclear.

The West made it practically impossible to implement Putin's plan of a joint economical zone from Vladivostok to Lisbon.
Latvia was a part of Russian Empire.
In case of global war with Russia small European countries who allied with US would be destroyed in the first place with their entire populations just because they host US military bases.
Russia has used "self-defense" as an excuse to rob Finland of lots of their historic lands after the war.
Taking Russia into the EU doesn't have any place in that, aside from as a really weird thought experiment.
wait
So there won't be a war or even if a war breaks out Russia and its allies would be destroyed.
In short, the very original purpose of NATO was to safeguard against an invasion of Europe.
I've never heard a European moan about the United States being a powerful ally or having a large military.
It's sily to say they are geographicaly European because some people consider the limit of Europe to be the Oural montain.
What are you talking about, Russia is completely predictable.
I've been to every country Eastern Europe, except Belarus, because fuck Belarus.
The pronunciation is [somewhat different] obviously
But have you asked yourself: by what cost all this economical growth happened?
Usually there's a choice between German and Russian, yet 99% end up choosing Russian.
There was also an adjustment (or maybe calculations based on new data).
We have given rights to ethnic minorities for literally HUNDREDS of years, from ethnic Tatars, to Kairaims (who were basically given their own town, land, and titles hundreds of years ago), to Jews, who were given the full rights underMagdeburg laws, and who never had problems with Lithuanians (only Russians in the late 19thC), and some thing that happened as the Nazis came to town and started handing out "status".
The length of the station is 163 meters
Saakashvili was authoritarian a bit, but against thiefs, corruptioners.
It would be a nice way to build up a case against Belarus, giving the Russians an "excuse" to go in and protect the Russians there.
We'll just have to agree to disagree on how Russia's belligerence should be confronted.
Because it was a throwaway land anyway that was supposed to be taken from Germany as a punishment.

That would be about 33x the amount of settled land in the West Bank.
Americans are called selfish by much of the rest of the world but in this case we seem to be the only one defending democratic values on two fronts.

How can an investigation agency go through a quick and accurate investigation within the election time frame, or before a president-elect becomes inaugurated.

Unless it's the other way around?
I find it unavoidable down the road, and you can sense it in the cautious rhetoric, (Russia has not been demonised as in the past) and slow response of the West to the Ukrainian war and the rest of the stuff Russia has been pulling recently.

Blaming Russia only seems to be en vogue now if one's from the EU.
Later in 2017, a referendum is planned in South Ossetia on whether or not to officially request annexation by the Russian Federation.
We have this satirical news website and they posted news about Russia donating their helicopter in order to fight the fires but, the title was:
Well, this parade was during 2010, we had different relations with the US at that time.
Sans joining Russia, this is literally how the Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union.
In fact it banned Chinese from entering the US for a long time.
They saw an opportunity to make a quick buck with these assholes and they helped run the country into the ground, especially with their unwavering support for Yeltsin, who was probably one of the most incompetent heads of state in the world
As far as Im concerned if Eastern Europe wants to look down its nose at the rest of Europe and its values they can gtfo out of the EU, stop taking our money for their shitty infastructure and go join their real cultural twin Russia.

I don't speak about politics but about people
I think Russians may be thinking too ideologically yet again.
It was a cascade of poor decisions (such as dismissing the alarm as false, because it malfunctioned in the past and locking the cinema hall) that resulted in a tragedy
China has no scruples about aligning themselves fully with moralless autocracies and is always on the lookout to secure sources of oil internationally.
The tragedy is that things could have been different, if the West would have acted smarter after the fall of the USSR.
Except he was pm and Putin was merely dodging around Russian law to keep control of the country.

They just need to remember where their borders start and end first.
The level of hate for anything Russia on this sub is amazing.
In results of betrayal: Boris Yeltsin
I was impressed and we had a good experience talking to each other
But that wasn't even the point: All I meant was that the Ukraine is massive and there's a lot of space and the conflict is only in a small area.
Good ties with Russia would benefit both parties and might put end to "cold war".
Get a government that is not secretly trying to abolish democracy and nobody cares
It was played publicly with many other names as a form of passive resistance.
Exactly how is the US encircling Russia in the West?

You're not taking into account the fact that we're talking about Russia, where there's a serious chance you could be arrested or face abuse from the authorities if you protest.
In fact in my opinion NATO has enough to blame for, with their aggressive policies towards Russia.
Peace is going to be abused for as long as Russia is given room to invade other countries.
They might be somewhat run-down, but they have lots of history and old architecture, nice lakes nearby and a growing scene of decent restaurants and bars
Well, NATO has no intention of invading Russia, so I think we're all good.
Imperialism, historical revisionism, suffocating internal discontent with a foreign policy victory, slowly destroying the European security system, bringing back Russia as a regional superpower, stopping Ukraine from joining EU/NATO etc.
No other country in Europe (maybe perhaps Russia, save innovation) is close to that.
This is what populism means: in order to get back at the USA we're the ones who are going to suffer the most from it, just like with the Russian sanctions.
It was up until 2008 that people insisted Russia is friendly and will never make wars again.
Looks like all those Ukrainian/Russian cigarette smugglers will have a new market I think...
They probably wouldn't get further than a few miles into Poland, it would be a complete suicide mission.
Of course the wealth might instead shift to a few CEOs of private corporations or whatever if the market opens up, but that's another issue.
What is important: which language they WANT to speak.
Yeah, Russian elections for example...
Try to give me at least one argument to invade them.
That is pretty much valid across the continent I think.
The Russians are trying, they've been trying for more than a century.
Russia Blames Ukraine for It’s own Shelling in Donbass
Firstly, they recognised abhazian passports with the same pretext as they've done it now in Ukraine, in a few years they started issuing their own passports to abhazians, and later one of their pretexts for war with Georgia was protecting "their" citizens.
Ukraine's decision to turn down Russia's loan/business offers led to the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the east of their country, let's see what happens with Belarus.

The article clearly states: The report said the increases were being driven mainly by heterosexual transmission in Russia.
Such is the state of the world that if the EU goes ahead with an army it will be too powerful and the US will need to leave NATO and align alongside the UK, Japan and India with Russia while Europe aligns itself with China and Pakistan (and hence the 'great silk road' infrastructure from China to Europe).

However, Britain's land army was not really used in the same way as that of France, Russia, Prussia, Austria etc.
Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny interview for HARDTalk BBC – about his plans for presidential campaign, his recent trial, relations between Russia and the West, Putin and Trump
Has the Belgian Parliament already approved how many days a year Belgians will have to crawl on their knees apologizing
Hence my question, given the headlines of some of the newspapers.
The fear here is that the United States is keen to see Russia as a potential partner and reluctant to share the view in Eastern Europe that Moscow presents a potent and immediate military threat.
Oh, don't worry, my friend, looks like the Meme War II is going to take place in France, so you probably won't miss it.
A lot of the people Russia saved in the East don't remember the subsequent occupation/dictatorial regimes as something very positive.
But still, it really amazes me that he managed to do the same to both the Communist and Nazi/Ultranationalist zealots at the very same time.
The climate is frustrating sometimes
It's about a list of things that these teens have to do like cut themselves, watch certain videos and so on and on the last day they commit suicide.
I met a really nice Russian guy in CS:GO once, made me realise that anything is possible.
The one that stood out to me most was some comic they posted implying that 1) Russia and the USA were at war, and 2) that Russia was winning because the American troops were all gay and too busy making out to fight (this was shortly after the repeal of DADT).
There are barely any Russians there.
Yes, I agree that Russia violated the agreement.
I do get the reasons but ultimately they are so pointless.
Russia is greek form of Rus and Belarus mean White Rus
It's the first cardinal number in the series of infinitely growing cardinal numbers
I also doubt that the Russian population would like to join the EU even if our political course makes a U turn.
Also the US are viewed by the russian population and the Kremlin as a threat to Russia and its interests, much more than France.
But what
The overwhelmingly majority of NYC residents don't live in tall buildings.
Hope you don't mind if I use this post to ask, what about Ukraine?
I don't want a war, conventional or otherwise, between the West and Russia.
I made a mistake, not homosexuality, but rights of homosexuals
Even Georgia managed to shoot down some russian air craft in the few days the conflict lasted.
This doesn't really matter today.
I guess that depends on how good the integration education programs are - they need to be pretty good to balance out what kids are taught at home
I am doing the erasmus in slovenia this year, do you guys have it?
I think that it’s normal thing when you want to eat meal
Literally everybody involved agrees that the Russians hacked the DNC.
Some characteristics are switchable and some create weirdness if you switch them
Pretty much same here, but I also have heard some stories from my grandfather about how he ate wood grouses, black grouses, pheasants, etc (cause he lived in a village for a long time and was a game hunter)
Russia chose to ignore the "legitimate wishes" of people of Transnistria for 20-odd years and South Ossetia's for a bit less.
Everyone who visits seems to know English, but of course that's self-selecting.
Russian backed extremists have also been discovered in Hungary where a explosion in Budapest, lead to a trail that ended with a shoot-out with a far-right nationalist stockpiling weapons.
Some characteristics are switchable and some create weirdness if you switch them
Granted it may be illegal but if you play illegal games, such as discharging a president in an unconstitutional way (with the help of foreign powers - USA, EU) the chaos is already ensured
Too close to Japan for our own good :\
We don't view them as the absolute danger either.
He has no supporters in Russia, because he's quit trying to build a network of them.
I wonder how she would feel if Morocco annexed part of France because they were just protecting North African speakers from her party.
Most of Europe and NATO are still pretty stressed out about Russia; considering the events that happened in Crimea.(Also, thank you for responding)
What I understand, not only that close
The forth party DPS are the "turkish party" their main voter base is from parts of Bulgaria, which are uneducated and mainly populated by turks, they are like medieval feudals there, the only way to do something is if you support the party and the party leaders like you, while they say they are pro Turkey, they are actually pro Russia and their leader is former Intelligence Agencies agent.
An endorsement from the president of Russia has to be worth its salt.
Oh yeah
They also use similar aid in the army to count down 3 seconds and synchronize volleys: «Три-и-иста, три-и-идцать, три!» or «Three hundred thirty three». [1:24]
May your empathic words not be remembered when Russia starts sending you their little green man
Backing a coup in Turkey, supporting militant groups hostile to Turkey, etc.
Russia highest person is a perfect tactic which can parry momentary menace better than anyone.
I think it depends on how you look at it.
Sorry - but do some of you really believe that people voting for right wing parties because of immigration is something invented by the Russians?
:) What do you think of the Crimean annexation and Russia's dirty game in eastern Ukraine?
Naturally we had to replace those BUKs with more relieable western products.
Violence in Ukraine escalated because they had long-standing unsolved problems, ethnical and moral.
Even our bad parties prefer EU and NATO (with one exception who couldn't even enter the parliament), or keep this public image, because siding with Russia is political suicide here.
It might have been better if they also had an interview with a pro-DNR person from a neutrality perspective, but this interview already feels like an attempt to counterbalance the inherent bias in a tour 100% controlled by the DNR.
Beards have been growing in popularity and really took off during the pandemic, since men stuck at home could grow through the awkward "too long for a stubble, too short for a beard" phase
Putin or someone else from Federal Security Bureau / United Russia.
Russian propagandists, trying to make a PR campaign, once again debunked their own previous statements: this time they showed on photos fragments of russian cluster bombs being defused by russian military in Aleppo.

His cabinet appointments have made it pretty clear that they will fight the Paris Agreement.
It's up to your own country to make sure that citizens become integrated.
“We’re the last defense from the Russians — if they come here, nothing will protect the EU further,” says Bondarenko.
You haven't done your research very well if you think they're simply right wing.
How is the relationship between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in BiH right now
It was a Buk operated outside its battalion
We don't expect any better from the Russian government, but the Brits are supposed to have some standards.
Just because North Korea is building nukes doesn't mean its now fair game.
Now I can go and take a cookie that I've earned.
If you don't have much time and don't want to risk, Aeroexpress is a better option
Either compromise, expose and interfere in Russia internal affairs so they learn it hard way.
Not that I think it is true, but there is a conspiracy theory that they intended to shoot down an Aeroflot plane, that would have given Russia an excuse to roll into Ukraine with great forces.
Simply to reduce Russian influence in the region.
The fact that Russia still thinks that some democratic, sovereign ex-USSR countries are still in Russia's sphere of influence says everything how paranoid and screwed up Russia's foreign policy is.
I don't know where people get this connotation that we hate Russians, it's their leaders that are threat to us, not their people.
It means if Russia was involved in any significant way, NATO certainly would not escalate to the point it did.
AFAIK, only two such places for a really long border: [Ivangorod] on Estonian border, divided by Narva river and [Chertkovo] on Ukrainian border, with border roughly along the railway tracks

at least they have some new practical ideas on how to make our lives better.
Majority is not ready, yeah
I barely ever watch the Russian media as I simply can't stand it for longer than a couple of sentences
When why Russians are still calling everyone fascist and Nazi, even though whole new generation is here?
I just want to point out that the vote for Radev was not in any case pro-Russia vote.
It was very useful to me in Western Canada when I was ordering my sushi in Vancouver.
You can call the whole of Syria a failed state.
Yea, maybe there are a significant number of experienced BUK-2 operators in Donbas and the Ukrainians simply abandoned their air defense weapons, or maybe Russia invaded Ukraine like Putin has admitted multiple times after lying about not being involved?
I'd say blame the Russians, they took and still trying to take everybody's land.
And yet, they are waging a war between themselves.
No, they're not justified, because they chose to escalate a fight they've already started instead of trying to end it peacefully.
I would guess it has to do with the type of government.
> don't have a tracksuit
Really, having been to Egypt a few times I've found Egyptians seem to think of Russians the same way Europeans think of British holiday makers.
As a Ukrainian this is about as offensive as most Europeans will get just a nice little 'get fucked', Russians will pm you videos of Ukrainian soldiers being tortured.
Mickevičius turned from Socialist to Communist, he was Lithuanian nationalist and so were his parents, but years of work against Tsarist Russia, imprisoment, and meeting Commies turned his political view, but he always cared about Lithuania being free, I just don't understand why he fought on the side of Russian SFSR, Pilsudski's brother (one of signators) was on Lithuanian nationalist side, while his brother (Pilsudski) was on Polish.

Their economy has a lot of potential though, and getting close to them would likely make them an invaluable trading partner rather quickly.
Lmao
I am not some hardcore free market supporter but France is too socialist.
People are just so used to live in the world divided by huge administrative formations called states that have a flag, an anthem, a parliament and so on, they have difficulties with realization it is not "default" state of things.
Russian Empire was gone by that time ;)
Realize that making you believe a certain way has a benefit to others even if it is untrue.

But there are people that *live* in the West and yet don't make any conclusions
An export nation against trade deals with a country like Canada.
So you agree the EU doesn't care about Moldova, but think Moldovans should agree to the lack of care they're getting from EU?
> Therefore it feels a bit like an overdimensional village
I had to explain to a group of junior highschoolers The Soviet union collapsed in 90's. They actually thought the Soviet union was still going
Moldova is not russian, so they have no business being there.
Marine Le Pen has a right to think that France allied with Russia will be stronger country than France allied with USA.

I would love to be the real estate agent who helps him selling that thing.
Baltic peoples love the US because they remember what Russia has done to them in the past and look to us to protect them because they're small.
Really messed with me, considering the stereotypes
What we *do* need is more energy independence from Russia and enough defence capability and strong enough societies and institutions to keep the Russian state on its own side of its borders.
Way to not stereotype the Russians m8.

Russia is only a threat if the EU splinters and can't mount a collective front.
Russia on the other hand has the power to change and challenge its fate so they look at her with both envy and admiration being drawn like a moth to fire....
I mean that Le Pen makes sure France goes in line with Russia's politics.
I am not too familiar with political views of Belarusians, but I do know majority of them speak Russian, unlike in Ukraine were there is a majority Ukranian speaking West with a long history independent from Russia.
Did not this heights began in Munich with your Chamberlain and their Mussolini and Daladier

This one really is the crux of the issue isn't it.
She's also very rational and would be able to ignore the shit their governments throw to her.
A non biased viewer might also observe that there have been 0 infractions or attemps of infractions of Russian borders.
But you could have shown some decency and kept silent.
and you can't just say to all this people "sorry you don't have 40 years to develop, you are now Russia", there is a price for this, and Russians weren't ready to pay this price:).
Russia is poor, but propaganda is cheap and very efficient.
Hyped FAAAAAAAAAR beyond his capabilities
Hell, I have been reading articles about how America has been abandoning it's role by letting Russia do all the dirty work in Syria, and I am supposed to be sad about that?
In the 90s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia had a period of extreme economic crisis (which is normal, considering they transformed a planned economy to capitalism).
Or they were invited to attack a country.
The article doesn't even reveal that.
I'd still prefer chicken wings
Considering that Finland was part of Russia as long as we were, until around 1917, we were on the same step, but when you guys just gave them Karelia, the best part of Finland, for nothing, well, who wouldn't want to be part of the USSR?
What does the Ukraine have that America needs?
Combined with the economic power that Russia has, it's able to more or less control most of its neighbours policies.

Our native language is so similar in sound, our accents are pretty much identical.
Sure, the war in Ukraine is terrible, but it's nowhere near the Cold War level of madness.
Though they were still somewhat ornate, they were much more understated and, frankly, elegant than the ostentatious and gilded monstrosities the English were putting out
because even countries that were occupied by Russia like Slovakia and hungary are becoming pro-russia because they identify with traditional values.
No, he's not, he even said something nice about Poland once, na-na-na-na-na-I-can't-hear-you!").
The Russian anthem most definitely.
Not the first one and probably not the last.
That is a really good question to me because most of the time I never associated Russia with these sorts of categories and never thought of it that way.

Amazingly, Hillary went full Mcarthy on Russia thinking this was somehow going to persuade voters.
And it appears that many Ukrainians in the East have gone to Russia.

Also I find that even genuine connection is harder to get in places like that
Like I said, Russia didn't fight anything in Libya and Nato/EU isn't in Syria.
Im most certain that most of english speaking Amercans use American media outlets and news channels to inform themselves.
>The first people to leave the ground
Russia wants USA and China to fight each other
Wouldn’t phrase it with “agreeing”. Many Russian people simply don’t have a choice, both because Putin blocks opposition, and also because Russia still has some very derpy political parties that include Communist USSR offshoots and far right nutjobs
It's located at the crossroads of Europe, Russia, Iran, and the Arab world, and the fact that NATO effectively controls access to the Black Sea is huge.
He doesn't have any management experience worth mentioning, only crazies would vote for him (at least I hope).

non-European [...] Russia [...]
Although I share your disgust for racism and other prejudices, it's not really fair to make the only speech that is "free" is the speech that you happen to like.
They know the West doesn't want direct military confrontation with Russia because it would probably result in nukes being used.
It can only be used when Russia leaves the Council of Europe, there's nothing in the constitution about banning death penalty.
In that context Russia stands for Russian goverment and its govermental apparatus.

We always thought the nuclear war could be between the US and Russia, but a nuclear war between Europe and the US is one hell of a plot twist.
I never said they have begun trusting them.
Seems like a weird coincidence.
Most of these "movements" in Russian populated areas of Caucasus exists only in author's head.
It should be spelled this way too, Семён. But ё is kinda non-obligatory letter in Russian and is often replaced with e, even though they sound completely different, and Semyons had fallen victims for it
It's worth mentioning that for the mindset of russian strategic planners these are actually small distances to push.
I know it's hard to understand, think of it in comparison with China - their model of administration is 2400 years old in its essence.
I am inclined to think your memory fails you.
Yeah it's not that companies like [Nokia] had anything to do with our success.

So are Canada, America, and China.
No wait, Russians interfered with that too.
He will turn 180° once the referendum is over.
Still a big question whether this friendship between Trump's administration and Russia will continue.
Furthermore a common EU army would like cut a lot of redundant costs, not to mention a the great educational experience of doing your military service in all of Europe with other Europeans.

Among the rest, it depends on the age.

Same with Latvia, Russia is quite good at pushing it's agenda that Russians are being mistreated, plus I think even some Latvians don't understand historical and legal reasoning behind this.
Cuisine from Central European nations and the Caucasus  are the most popular
So even in Russian, it is wrong to put a comma after an adjective in that particular case
1480 (Mongol-Tatar yoke was lifted completely) - 1605 (it's complicated, but basically Poland tried to get Russia under itself), 1612 (poles were expelled from Moscow and the rest of the country by the Second Volunteer Army) onwards
when Russia outright has anti-gay laws
But that would just result in MAD where all life on Earth loses out.

From what I've seen, many Bulgarians would only know about the Russians, so I am happy that you mentioned the other nations as well.
Some of them are trying hard to weasel out of hard questions, or go for total wishful thinking ("Trump is not pro-Russian!
Also will of the fight is the key word here.
Well he's been in power for a quite long time now and Russia's governmental system is a borderline dictatorship where the president holds a lot of power.

It's still valid, like the Russian and AH, etc.
Swiss Airlines forgot to include the border between Estonia and Russia
1993-1997 we signed agreements to demilitarize all our borders.
Sadly they can't because Russia is clingy leech.
USSR was just mask for Russian Empire 2.0
it was given as a gift from Russia to Ukraine by Khrushchev, and is 90%+ Russian
Europe is really going to a gunfight with a knife.
Obviously people who got uninvolved either during war or past war also got shot or prison time
I don't remember the exact terminology, but that's a feature shared by a number of European languages, including Russian and not including English

Russia is just 40% of Europe by area, so it should be no more than 40%.
Even though it sounds harsh and even wrong, this was really the effect that the Soviet occupation and illegal Russian immigration had on many Estonians.
I always wonder about the Russian flairs...how many are real lol
He said kids live with Ukrainians and Belarusians and learn Russian faster.
Now the same people are usually rather enthusiastic about Trump.
Perhaps there's a regional variation in English, so it's acceptable in Ireland
The point is Finland has occupied only Karelia
We are nothing like "new dialect in every village" Britain, for example.
But that would mean an actual all-out war and a real World War 3, possibly.
My area of research is also represented well in both.
Some people will say WWII but why didn't WWI, a much more brutal war for Western Europe which these sentiments originated, trigger it?
Russia should give those places back for our 100th birthday next year :P
This is information war, nothing else and it should be taken seriously.
Otherwise, EU as their new patrons pays for the instigated coup and its consequences.
I have no idea if a pro-Russia person is to blame for this provocation, but you sure seem to gloat over the news and quite eagerly insist in your comments.
~~we call that byelorussian and ukrainian~~
We see Russia putting a lot of money into trying to influence elections.
You as a Russian may not understand Bulgarian that well probably because Bulgarian, while being a Slavic language, has some unique characteristics, which it shares along with Macedonian(but that is another story).
[There is someone who will protect cattle minorities!]
We started with an independence guaranteed by Great Britain and France.
It is not, they're pressurized water reactors, supplied by Russians.
Not when you get beaten by thugs for speaking language other than Russian.
It's much harder to keep your infrastructure, trade and economy running, when you're a large sparesely populated country, with huge distances between cities and with a territory, which most of it doesn't have any economic value.

The Lithuanians built an LNG terminal in Klaipeda which can actually serve a good chunk of the energy needs of the entire Baltic region, with Norway supplying much of the gas (in the future, even America could supply some gas there).
So, please, leave your xenophobic bullshit with yourself
Some are less arbitrary than the other.
What it actually does is making people believe they are under attack.
There's a very apparent 'Russia is the bad guy and everything it does is evil' propaganda that keeps people from making comparisons objectively.

I'll prefer a plane over 4+ hours on a day train or 12+ hours on an overnight train
Both of my parents have significant Jewish ancestry, but I’m not religiously Jewish, just ethnically
Imagine Poland in the Balkans, lol there would be only Ottomans to deal with, no freakin Moscovy/Russia, HRE/Germany.
In Russian, it is «кто не спрятался — я не виноват», which literally translates to “if you haven’t found a place to hide, it’s not my fault”

On English lessons we are do printed one because westerners don't give a shit so do teachers are
As you know, there exists a consensus of experts on its causes.
Russia will never return Crimea, but maybe more sanctions will get them to stop invading and arming "rebels" in eastern Ukraine.
how can I know that the exact same shit isn't being shoved down my throat from western media?
A nonbinding referendum in 2008 resulted in 77% of voters supporting NATO accession.
Was quite interested to see his party broadcast video that was posted here.
That would indicate that while the Russians can deal with the sanctions without running into any vital problems, there are solid reasons to prefer the non-sanction status.
But nearly everything else about the story turns out, upon investigation, to be untrue.
With all that money it still appears that the European armies are less capable than the Russian army, if you look at the Libyan war, the British and French had to ask the Americans for bombs because they were about run out of them, now look at Syria with the Russian intervention and East Ukraine, the Russians are not running out of bombs or supplies, they are still achieving their geopolitical goals without paying as much as the Europeans.
Russia's violation of a nuclear treaty is a direct threat to Europe's security
Probably Bulgaria, too, despite that recent elections.
If he can't, he may be hopeless.
Honestly I looked this up and I don't really see how Sweden played a role
Russia recognised Baltic states and annexation of Baltic states by USSR long time ago, stop imagining shit and then get offended by figments of your own imagination.
Not like I'm the most disciplined driver, going on flashing green is everyday thing for me at familiar places, but red is red.

Russians are tired of Luka too tbh

Even if the only thing I will do there is take pictures of Art Nouveau houses lol
But generally beyond the Turkish Straits and Urals.
I only get sensitive when people confuse countries east of Germany with Russia.
e.g. [this one] says "пшлнх мкднлдс", which literally translates to "gfy mcdnlds". [another one] warns you not to "обострись" - this word is a portmanteau of "обосрись" (to shit yourself) and "острый" (spicy)
I don't think Russia cares that much about us but we have a pretty terrible relationship.
Except that in the 1968 "Invitation letter" (is that how one translates "Zvac&iacute; dopis" into English?), there are layers of Communist gobbledy-gook before it goes to the point.
While some might say that it sounds good, it brought a lot of instability and eventually opened a door for the Bolsheviks to seize power, then the Civil war started because of that and, finally, the USSR was established, which is not a nice thing
Or a significant Russian minority to try to keep Finland in check.
Russia could not intervene without itself taking the risk.
Well the common conspiracy theory on this is that if there is a push to force some sort of confrontation with Russia, its time is shrinking as Trumps inauguration is getting near.
Word Ukraine has a wrong meaning in video, it has different etymology.
China and Europe wouldn't be steamrolled by the US and Russia, not even close.
The bear in the room: Francois Fillon and the lurch towards Russia

Turkey was a victim of agressive wars and Aegean islands were taken by force in 20th century, which means Turkey has some claims on them and probably a part of Turkish society believes that they have right to revenge and restore "justice".
Same in Russian, but this is rather...
Yep, there are so many German words in Russian, it's unbelievable
Still, Eastern Europeans need to get their shit together and build up their armed forces as a response to Russian posturing (or in the case of Ukraine and Georgia, outright aggression).
This "victim" narrative you're pushing nowadays is beyond pathetic.
Here's why: they keep their money in the West.
Occupying it literally means sawing a branch one is sitting on.
Today I learned Russia isn't reliant on imports.
Really
and this is something that is much worse than "not paying taxes".
Why would you prefer to live in Swedish Oblast
The reason for that result might also be that there are no courses for Swedish speakers, so you have either people learning Swedish through English or Arabic (and soon also Russian), or Swedes learning other languages through English.
Don't know if it's a combination of anti-communist sentiment or because of Ceausescu's nationalism and isolationism from the Soviet Union, or because of Basserabia or a combination of all of the above.
I can hear German, Polish, Russian, French and nordic in general.
Is there an evidence that Russia rigged referendum in Crimea?
As Russian i am happy that we can do deals with any country without going through an union like this.
It will never be a threat to the US, we are too intertwined and there is a very long history of alliance between us.
but there was still an extremely noticable difference in the Russian government from 2008-2012, which was Medvedev's presidency.
It wasn't a cakewalk for the German either, but with Moscow in their hands they would control the railroads running north to south, really limiting our logistics, not to mention the blow to the morale
Ah, Eastern Poland investment opportunities I've been hearing about
From a societal point of view, well I understand the *pro*, but we need a.year to train a soldier that can be deployed in Syria, and I guess an extra one to fight against Russia/US.
Many Europeans go to America...I expect Trump to bring down the hammer
Another day, another crackpot comment by /u/Xeno87 about Russia.

I fully expect Russia to move troops aggressively and see how Trump reacts.

It's not seen as a problem for the majority of the Americans, the problem isn't that we spend that much it's why we spend that much.
If there were a radical religious threat to Netherlands they would be much more radical than Atatürk was about it (there is an Islamist threat now and they are getting radical fast btw) 23 revolution was much more kind to religious nutjobs than other revolutions of its kind like the French, German or Russian revolution.
Feeling too safe on crowded streets, huh?
The Russian embassy to the US has a small amount of information that EU citizens need Russian visas (scroll down): Here's the consulate in the Netherlands: which directs you to their processor:
There was no Russia in the 10th century.

So Russians invade, shell cities, shell UA army from within cities, do whatever they want and then accuse the Ukrainian government, without blaming their own government.

But school teachers say it's "bad grammar".
Ukraine is not your pawn unable to choose its own direction and control its foreign policy.
If we follow your thinking then economic situation in Russia should be on the level of 90s now...
Sure people will say bad America/whatever country when directly asked about it but the articles about them aren't upvoted yet there is a evil Russia article on the front page of this sub on a daily basis.
As you said yourself if russian minorities elsewhere have problems (mainly instigated by Russia itself) they are free to move to the biggest country in the world aka mother Russia, right?

They're fully determined to see us as an enemy and are as such a general threat to our way of life and our allies.
Intent on Unsettling E.U., Russia Taps Foot Soldiers From the Fringe: Moscow is cultivating an array of far-right extremist groups, spreading disruption and hoping that a few will develop into important and disruptive players.

I don't think Britons who voted leave care if other countries followed their lead
Some nationalist and unsurprisingly current government, while talking about late Empire, concentrate on “culture”, developing economy and “patriotism”, while neglecting obvious flaws of the dying system
So is Russia, safe due mind-blowing vastness of territory, that protected them from both Napoleon and Hitler, who managed to conquest most of Europe before finding their demise after heading East.
For me:

I'm not sure of what the main ancestor of Finnish could be considered, but either your language changed little with time and for some reasons didn't go throught the same process as most other languages, or they must have had an unrealistic number of cases
Most of the words are relatively short or they have a medium length, some of the most common are even shorter than in the English: brother - брат, with - c, from - из, people - люди

The only thing Europe has what Russia might want is warm seas that do not freeze when its winter, but once again, that's not worth all the effort and victims.

And this kind of secularism is exactly what brought religious conservaitves back into prominance in such places as Turkey, the former French colonies, or the former USSR.
More likely Hofer with his recent mention in a tv duel of "how he has great connections to and in Russia"
It makes more sense to compare those
To my knowledge, Russian/Kazakh/Belarussian elites have less competition for resources, so they can develop them, get their major share and invest the rest into growth.

The report says that Russia has troops in Crimea and that this constitutes an invasion.

NATO is nothing but a 21st century Maginot Line to them.
It's a grand fathered irregularity, that probably causes next to no issues ever.
The only thing that I am willing to give you is that politicians had to be deliberately vague about the intent of a missile shield, because if you talked about Russia you got accused of wanting to start a Cold War and Russia not being a threat anymore.
Hence bullying an isolated Georgia is cool, sending expeditionary forces to Syria is fine, sending *top-bants* to NATO HQ is a-ok but the only way Russian troops would cross to engage NATO forces would be by accident.
I'm not so sure about last part of this chain.

During the Deluge, were the Swedish also invading Russia; or was that a bit later?
We're very important because Russia, as the main aggressor, takes dissatisfaction with internal problems of European countries from them
Then Russians love credit for Soviet achievements.

Russia can't even provide enough food for it's entire population on it's own, and has very little industry outside of mineral extraction and natural resources, which are already held and operated by the oligarchs under what would clearly be called a fascist control scheme.

Maybe this is why Farage seems convincing to you: unless it's expensive, it cannot be valuable!
I should have written, until Russia gets out of Ukraine.
UK and US have powerful militaries, if you are worried about Russia, it makes sense to favor them.
give me personally 100$ billion dolalrs annual budget, nuclear capabilities and 25 to 50 years to prepare, and I myself will be able to handle Russia
I don't think many people understood the link to Russian propaganda.
he EU can categorise Russia as other and illiberal and undemocratic and to some extent ignore Russia's feelings about the EU, but it cannot really do that with the UK.
It's possible we had different experiences.
My biggest cultural conflict with the Americans on this site is over (what I view to be) faux positivity and general insincerity
I think we should at least decriminalise it, because in Russia you can be jailed for 7 years for like 3 grams of cannabis
Situations when all choices are just really bad are pretty rare
I don't think we should go out of our way, but Russia can generally agree with us after all they are capitalist, secular, and in everything but practice a democracy.
1) There will be integrated western Europe, integrated Intermatium and then weak Russia 2) integrated western union ends on current eastern polish borders, similiar to the shape of napoleonic Europe and then there's stronger Russia, probably having Baltics and of course Ukraine.
Russia's geopolitical stance is highly relevant for Europe and the UK even if we don't seem to care.
could probably have had better relation with Russia too.
Sometimes even in groups which are all "liberal opposition" and "anti-system". Makes me sad about the ignorance and arrogance of my compatriots

And Russian propaganda is not particularly successful – if you take *any* part of Russia and hold a referendum on joining Sweden, the result would be a "yes" with the percentage of yes votes varying from 90% to 100% (unless the referendum is conducted by the Russian authorities, then the result would be 146% voting "no")
I wonder why that is, seeing as many other Populist far right parties in Europe are fond of/bankrolled by Russia.
Russia know how to play the geopolitics game too, especially against the USA.

Let's start worrying about the former when there's actually even a single sign of it doing so.
The trouble with this approach is that, for it to work, the EU-27 would need to be uniformly afraid of Russia, and this is emphatically not the case: not only there are already some governments that are quietly pro-Russian, like Greece's, but even France, if François Fillon makes the first cut tonight in the French center-right primaries, is very likely to have an overtly pro-Russian president by next summer (either Fillon or Marine Le Pen).

The Romanovs had every opportunity to realize they absolutely should not be in charge of anything, especially not a world power and ether abdicate or take on a mostly ceremonial role like their British cousins, but they instead clung to absolute power and used wars, first against Japan and then against the central powers to try and unify the country behind them.

Centre of power is always the most important, even if it depends on the regions.
Yeah, these're our words for godparents/godchildren too.

Then we have a disaster, our common home is destroyed.
As if a random Russian citizen has anything to do with what the government and soldiers are doing...You ask a random Russian "what the fuck are you doing" the correct answer would be nothing, because there's virtually nothing he can do, they didn't even elect Putin, the whole "election" is just for show, nothing more so quit with this collectivist guilt tripping bullshit please.
Considering Russia as a separate entity would make more sense than calling it Asian.

What I find worrying about your assessment is that Russia has been in an economic crisis since about the last 5 years and is facing tons of sanctions and Putin isn't losing a gram of support.
Why would Russians be invading from Sweden?
If the Ukrainian government thought they were getting anything worthwhile from it, they were sadly mistaken.
No one is playing innocent since i don't care about mercs
It isn't just an Anglosphere thing

European cities might be better in that regard, but try to use public transportation to get to a cinema or to work from some american suburb, especially if you want to do it on repeat
Even captured Moscow from the west (though to be fair, it was held by rebels at the time and the Swedish army led by Jakob De la Gardie simply re-took it for the Tsar).
However this is strange, historically Romania should be like most behind-carpathian or Balkan countries, seeking in Russia counterweight against growing Turkey and Moldova would be that anti-russian Romania as they're more geographically threatened by Russia.

Racial purity is a myth,the eurasian indo-european peoples that makes up the vast majority of the european population today was a mixed race population that had their ethnogenesis in southern Russia.
I hate it when people hold Russia and the US to entirely different standards but then come to a generalised conclusion that compares them on one level, as if they were essentially the same.

Like the British, the people do not want to commit 100% to becoming Europeans, but Europe has mostly positive connotations of quality (just add "Euro-" to anything you're selling), while Asia is the land of brutality, sloppiness and greed.
Go home and ask yourself why Putin and Medwedew are billionaires while you have to lie on the internet for a few Rubels.

Since when does Kazakhstan share the same latitude as Finland.
But the Russian language isn't know for the large amount of the long words, it doesn't have that much of them, frankly.
Ukraine hasn't existed as a state until 1991.
Yet it got invaded and occupied by Russian forces with the help of local Russians, leading to the annexation of Crimea and ongoing battles in the east.

Btw, what was the strategical reason behind decision of not letting Chechnya out after the collapse of USSR?
First of all Russia is an important trade partner.
And how can you even justify Russia's actions from the russian side.

By Russians, that actually drop bombs on Syria.
Why are you making your wife bake those swine NATO pastries right before her gang rape by the noble Russian soldiers?
We had pretty good trade relations for most of the 2000's but what happened in the long term is instead of reforming and changing for the better we got a Russia that simply started playing Imperium with half of Europe again, which would plunge our trade prospects in the long term with half of Europe and put political tensions in an all time high.
Ah yes, Euronews, owned by an Egyptian billionaire and now by a heavily politically slanted NBC.

It's not even only the typical Russia, Turkey, Serbia, England etc but rather just about any country.
You're right, we should assume Russia would invade every one of its neighbors unless a superior force is there to stop it.
Well, would a war between Russia and the EU be a conventional war?
This malicious expansionist narrative is what Russia has been pushing for decades.
No, because it was Georgia who attacked first.
Lending Support to Baltic States Fearing Russia
Both US and Russia sell monkey models to their clients.

They even call Germany as Merkel's Germany every so often, even though it's much more apt to call Russia like that.
No intonation whatsoever, it's like he's reading from a teleprompter for the first time.
The question of Russia's genetic background (I'm mostly thinking about Northern Russia's Ugro-Finnic genetic footprint) is another matter.
Those two are outside of Moscow, though, so they could easily have older busses
They simply take everything, including high standard and peace in Europe as granted, and care about their little pleasures in life a lot.
It like a chancellor of Germany would be a puppet of the prime minister of Romania.
Unity day
If we're going by the threat of bad government, the risk seems higher in just about any place you can name, compared to Europe.
I could reasonably say that Moscow would probably be ok with only public transport

Europe = 507 Ml people - Russia = 143 Ml people, just if Europe fall apart Russia is a threat for EU.
All you are doing is helping Russia create non existent tensions between Poles and Ukrainians.
I played the original DotA for a short period of time like 10 years ago.
Has it ever been majority Ukrainian (say counting by language)?
The position is already there and the attentions (not necessarily a loan like for the FN, but officials who talk to you, invite you to conferences...in particular if you are rejected and despised by many at home, it predispose you nicely, in particular if you're not a government/mainstream party).
English is a nightmare
The Baltic countries being more positive about Russia than Denmark Sweden
In school they teach us that Russia liberated Bulgaria.
But it is still considered liberal.
The EU's problem is not becoming an evil crypto-colonialist (by which I mean let's replace Baltics with Russians in the Baltic) power but too fractured and indolent.

The Serbian government didn't had a proxy state to do their dirt for them like in Bosnia and in 99 the Bosnian genocide was well know and the international community had put Milošević' government in high alert.
At this point, it's worse if Assange *isn't* a Russian stooge.
That's not a quality I would characterize these languages with.

Most Russians actually support their government and especially Pitun
You don't even know what xenophobia is, do you?
We can hopefully restore our relationship with Russia, and cooperate with both the US and Russia in Syria and Iraq.
E.g. "the police is investigating" obviously feels wrong
I don't think that you can somehow educate people to prevent this.
Being our first trip to Western Europe and due to the really different tastes we have we'll make a very classic trip.
Russia wasn't part of the ICC in the first place, they never ratified the treaty.
It’s a relatively new building, but it’s notable
Austria is a haven for Russian oligarchs.
Soviets to Czechoslovak people
The criticism levelled the US now is akin to biting the hand that feeds you, European politicians are quite short-sighted in this regard with little geopolitical decorum.
This far from Moscow, people didn't feel they have a say in the politics, they had already had their share of heated discussions during Ukraine crisis, so they just stopped caring at all.
Isn't calling Russia European offensive to its Turkic, Native Siberian, Far East etc.
Nope, brought up by Russian parents in Cologne and Bavaria.

Monaco is annoying since it’s a just tax haven for billionaires
And so on
I understand that it’s not so common in Australia since cigarettes cost 25$ lol
*How imaginable is it that Russian agents infiltrated high levels of Hungarian secret services?*

He is a man-child, but if you respond to his childish behavior and escalate this business to a geopolitical crisis, Russia will take advantage.
Is there a significant propaganda being made on tv?
Oh wait no, it took time but we discovered he was Polish agent, so we killed him, burned him and shoot his ashes into direction of Warsaw
"Oh, you're using the Russian alphabet!" *triggered*
Also not sure why you think Poles are somehow pro-Russian.
Yeah, as a US libertarian leaning citizen I'm bothered by the extent of the Putin praise.
It literally makes the atmosphere of realism a little interrupted)
Russia is looking to destroy the stablility of western civilzation and I find it disheartening to see that so many are blind to Russias evil ambitions.
Bulgaria has like 10 operational ancient Mig-29...

Poor Russia, being bullied by all those mean countries who won't let it just peacefully force-annex it's neighbours.
I assume you live in the west - you're just hearing more about these things because the tensions are higher than they used to be 5 years ago.
And majority of Russians are really looking forward to burning down Moscow again anyway
I think the CIS exit is still going on
Hezbolla is actually fighting against AQ in Syria right now.
Le Pen has a *much* lower chance of happening.
On the other hand, Venezuela isn't using it's resources to wage war, build up military and run a massive propaganda machine, nor is Venezuela the target of international sanctions.

The crooks found in Putin an ally, they are not willing to admit it because of public opinion but to me it's the only logical conclusion.
Correct, I will never accept an alliance with Russia.
I think it was always us europeans who attacked them and they counterattacked us.

Voices and translation usully better in this case and western developers mostly don't give a fuck about cyrillic fonts so you play with standard ones and it breaks immersion
It would be a clusterfuck because every single civilisation on Earth has committed murder and theft at some point.

Things that will slowly become a normality because of the regressive left and their policies towards "tolerance" towards importing other cultures which ironically leads to more intolerance in previously tolerant places like the western world.

Obviously, Saint Patrick is a true official orthodox saint, as all the saints before the great schism that didn't share ideas opposite to the teachings of Orthodox churches (Isidore of Seville isn't recognized as a saint, for example, because of filioque).
As the Russian economy declines further he will need to take drastic steps to ensure internal support.
I wouldn't be surprised if that was part of the idea (blame war on west/poroshenko, cause an actual civil war and mass protests to get another pro-Russian president and parliament).

Russia accuses Ukraine of sabotaging Trump
Ignorant question but isn't a large portion of that region ethnically Russian anyways in terms of culture language and values anyways?
The residents of Crimea are now Russian, with Russian passports.
However, in inflected forms, "о"/"е" is kept when it's followed by another syllable ("пiчь" -> "печi"; "нiс" -> "носа")
For example, *бояться* (boyat'sya) means *to be afraid*, *они боятся* (oni boyatsya) means *they are afraid*. The pronunciation is exactly the same, that's why many people make this mistake

Well it isn't the first time Germany will rule over France
Nono I said this is all concidence and Russia would not do something like that.
I think that it is excessive to connect nationalism and flag worshiping
I actually agree with most of what you said,but I dont think appeasing Russia is the way to go.I also believe that we should be harsher with foreign tyrants like the saudis or Erdogans Turkey aswell.

I can go to prison for questioning certain individual parts the holocaust on my blog but I can do a speaking tour fully denying any deaths due to socialism in Russia / Eastern Europe, China and Cambodia etc with no problem.
With tint of sentiment
Also I think knowledge of Russian might help to understand Slavic languages.
the problem with Russia is that even Putin is not the ugliest its face:).
Unfortunately it's reality as well
Interesting=) We have a very similar idiom here in Siberia

More looks like someone wants ethnic Russians with strong sentiments to Russia to leave
I wonder what the Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Austrians, Russians, Syrians, and on and on and on have to say about this.
And the very good Czechoslovakian military factories
It's just that he isn't as blatantly pro-Putin as her.

I see what you mean
I am starting to learn Russian, just so I can enjoy Russian propaganda (and out of solidarity with the Russian people).
Why are these protests breaking out in Russia and Belorussian at the same time?
But can you try, just for a change, not extrapolate the whole concept on every random Russian you're communicating with
He probably means how it is in real life, nowadays it's hard to find people speaking in a particular dialect, unless one looks for older people in some villages I guess
Bit late to the party, but the "Elephant out of a fly" and "Don't spit in the well" exist in Russian too.
Agree
And unstable Germany doesn't bode well for the whole Europe.
Donetsk is yet another post-Soviet area that Russia tries to first dislodge away from another country, then annex it into itself.
And it did fuckall to get them to give up the areas they occupied in Georgia (since 2008 or so, almost 10 years), and Crimea is still Russian as well.
A whole bunch of tour companies offer packages and will take care of the visa
Sounds more like Russia+racism.
Yeah, that is quite common, but in more corrupt countries like Ukraine and Russia, the alien criminals are allowed to continue their criminal acts, as long as they support the government.
It was suspected that they were the result of mixing incompatible drugs, sedatives and antihistamine.
Serbia is still generally a pro Russian country even if they want to join the EU which is purely for economic reasons .
It'd be another story if they had just falsified some documents, but what wikileaks released was real.
The problem being for Russia is that they took a lot of their ground before Ukraine had time to ramp up mobilise and train their volunteers.
We do plenty of blaming within the US and we don't tend to hide our problems.
Look at all that red in Russia/Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa north of the Congo.
I have a simple haircut, don't smile at random strangers
If you value your freedom, if you value democracy, if you value the relative prosperity we currently have, you should be paying attention, because its all under attack right now.
Well, they do have 3500 T-80s and 700ish T-90s, which is a lower number than the total number of M1's, but then again, Russian tank doctrine is quite different as well.
Usually multi-headed and can be killed only by cutting off his heads
what do you mean is not comparable?
It was Crimean Tatar, but it was a vassal state.
Arab - 6% positive, 23% neutral, 63% negative and 8% D/K.
That opinion is also strongly influenced by Russian propaganda.
I have to say though, I'm surprised that we have a reputation of binge drinking, because we always think of Europeans in the same sense: Irish with their whiskey, French with their wine, Russians and their vodka.
Too much Czech beer might explain my listening comprehension.
As in "it looks cool" or "I generally think it's a good thing"?
Why are you so sure that France is likely to get a Russia friendly president?
From your own safety perspective it is much better for you to have good relations with Russia then Ukraine...
It is quite popular in my hometown, but it's not really developed on a national level due to poor infrastructure (for rugby)  and lack of financing
I know, I know, I'm Russian myself.
Dont worry, if Ukraine falls, you will have your chance to prove yourself against the Russian demons :)
I'm Russian and I agree your language does sound similar to mine
But not every sector is touched by the sanctions and some got badly hit, especially the textile/clothing, leather, footwear and furniture sectors where I am pretty sure Russia used to be in the top 3 export partners.
If only such enjoyer ever existed
Definitely - to me Portuguese is like Spanish with a Russian accent, and some Arabic loanwords thrown in.
We dont go to Russia for alcohol, not to mention we need a visa for that.
Even now, after NATO reinforcements arrived in its Eastern flank (Poland, Baltics Romania), Russia still have like twice as many soldiers and tanks stationed in Kaliligrand alone, plus they have delpoyed Iscanders there.
Each generation is more and more likely to abandon religion.
It was _partly_ created by human activity, yes (ineffective agricultural policies, fanatic communists seizing seeds, some farmers burning their crops) but the years prior to the famine had been vary bad ecologically which dramatically exacerbated it.
but I tend to take what they say with a grain of salt because they're happy to sell copy by using sensationalism and exaggeration
Well, there is Vienna, particularly the inner city where I think Russians like to buy penthouses, but they are not too many.
I hate the tall Enter with a passion
P.S. We also share lots of old Slavic and old Byzantine names with other Slavic countries
They represented less than 4% of the population.
Germans have never had a positive opinion of America.
My point was that West seriously inflates the level of Russian craziness.
The Russian hacking scandal is not that they stole data, it's that they stole data and integrated it into a propaganda campaign to influence the American election to prefer Trump over Clinton.
Also constitution: the federal law is legit
Of course, but some ethnic minorities create for an interesting situation.
And war with Germany, France and the UK is not something Russia would win, unless they used their nuclear arsenal, but no one would win that.
Granted those people are still a minority.
[Lindsey Graham] I would guess.
I want to thank Finland for all the nice things we have just over the border
The only thing they have for us is a response to whatever we do.
States like Poland or Latvia actively shut out refugees and block EU proposals that would make them accept more of them.
Every single US president since WW2 is a war criminal
Self-defence law is complicated here.
So one can say "Я стар, я просто суперстар", that will mean "I am old, I am just a superstar".
It's funny how you are painting him as a neo-nazi here, while he is called a "liberast USA secret agent" in Russia.
Russia seems to be the black sheep of Europe.
Now Communism isn't a threat, what happens to Eastern Europe isn't really an issue anymore.
I would be very surprised if places that far from Russia had any changes at all.
When the economy goes down, just blame one of these groups and you will still get votes
I even haven't heard about him until this post.
And as you said as Russia, British got stronger, OE got weaker and weaker.
But when it was finished he tore out the eyes of the architects who built it so "they could never build something so beautiful again" nice guy :)
Let's lift the sanctions so we can punish them again with the same sanctions !
Non-Russians, which one do you find culturally nearer, US or Russia?
And those Soviet people who stayed here are old now and they are not going to change their place of residence.
Besides, Russia will just be expanding their sphere of influence since Trump doesn't seem to care about anything other than walling up his country.
Based on my past experience, unfortunately it is much more likely to be the latter, it is not like Ukraine is lacking them.
Cooperation in military industry is also going down as Russia switches to Kamaz for some of the heavy machinery elements that used to be produced in Belarus.
I just get rather bored of their inflated presence in the world.
Most of the times something Germanic, probably because of 'ja'.
People go protesting, thousands of protestors arrested, clashes with the police reported, Internet mostly shut down for the entire country, workers go on strikes across the country, Tikhanovskaya was forced to record the "please don't go on the streets" speech and leave the country
The joke is that if the Russians are not invading from the east the Russians are invading from another direction.
They care much more about the strenght of their army and the power of their diplomats than they care about their human needs like not paying the most for groceries in the whole of Europe because of sanctions that their dear leader put in place.
The Kremlin's Trojan Horses: Russian Influence in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom
The huge area comes from the fact that Russia is a huge area.
People really love to hate on Serbs here, and then they wonder why they are moving away from the European way of life and are friendly with Russia, Russia is like the only friendly country towards Serbia
To be fair, though, pretty much every English textbook teaches "I have got
Around 3.000.000 civilians (estimations, counting both Armenian and Muslim civilians) were either massacred or relocated outside of the mainland Anatolia.
We ourselves wouldn't want to be overly dependent on a single supplier anyways.
My favorite one being a dialog between two Russians that call protagonists barbarians because they are led by a female
Otherwise, yes, you'd just take off the gloves
Selling of Alaska mb
North Korea: n/a but i feel sorry for them
I don't remember Russia importing anyone.
Russia Introduces a Border Zone With Belarus
None of them died when they were taking Crimea.
Some schoolkid from Siberia reskinned a common Linux distro for his school project and played it up as a new Russian-native OS
It is extremely uncommon
Ahh, yes, the good old "I'm mad at Russia therefore everyone has to be mad at them" egoistic point of view
I'm in academia, so I had to visit Cambridge for a student conference and poster presentation (we had a boat trip across the city river and lived in a Harry Potter-like school, complete with looong dinner tables), Glasgow for a science outreach event (I expected locals to have incomprehensible accents, but it was actually fine), and Manchester for a kidney conference (all the students and professors went to a Chinese restaurant after the event, I saw a bull kidney on the menu and thought "well, I study them, time to find out what they taste like")
Have you heard of Transnistria?
However if you look closer Austria does still exist:
) and I can understand people who use translation is such cases because your knowledge of English might be not enough
Outside of Europe – definitely Shanghai, China.
Fröken Sverige (**ö** as in **ear**ly?) sounds funny :D
I'd say currency exchange rate is the primary reason there are less foreign workers now, not extra law enforcement.
Thus it makes sense for the purpose of the narrative that Russia helps the socialist party.
I moved to another country so as not to join the military.
Which seems more plausible at this point?
And finally, if it’s your first day eating out alone, YOU HAVE TO EAT
those French soldiers are there to make sure Russia does not attack......because if they do, they will kill those soldiers, thus automatically force France to declare war on Russia.
Can you show any hard facts that western Agencies have been involved?
I would say not only Russia but Turkey too.
Having a problem doesn't mean Russians aren't exploiting that problem (and, by all means, not necessarily directly).
-General insincerity; this is definitely fed by the upvote culture of Reddit, but suffice to say that it seems a great chunk of what they write (especially when pursuing humour) is for the purpose of pandering
Ukraine would not be a good idea, if we want to keep the remaining goodwill from Russia.
Uprising in Donbass started after revolution in Ukraine, especially after 42 opponents of the new regime were [burned alive in Odessa]#Trade_Unions_House_fire).
Or like we see today in Ukraine I guess
That will of course also mean an economic loss for the US.
If you think your government is worse than theirs, you're falling for the Russian propaganda that aims to equate it's actions to yours.
He's pretending like he's so retarded he doesn't understand that NATO views Russia as its main enemy.
I am a peaceful man and a coward.
The EU is led by people who'd rather side with Saudi Arabia headchoppers than Russia.
You just want the US to fight Russia for you, and then you'll point fingers and tut tut about "the world police"
Crimea is not a disputable territory.
Transnistria was never in Romania.
A red star is associated with Moscow in Russia
Why can't they just make posters for another students to take only what they are planning to eat?
It's a Simpsons reference
Only majority positive results were for
Generally yes, but that also depends on how protective your parents are
I really, really doubt that would ever happen.
We're Orthodox too, but no way we'd lean towards Russia.
The problem is that any potential silk road to Europe either goes through Russia or Turkey,autocratic countries that hate western civilization in general and europe in particular.
Normally we would have had some form of protectionism until we got on our feet since the fall of communism.
It was here where they came up with the theories that moldavians and romanians are 2 entirely different ethnic groups, changed the history of Moldova by removing any evidence of a common past, claimed that the languages used west and east of the Prut river are different and even tried to invent a new ''moldavian'' language from scratch (by mixing elements of romanian with russian and ukrainian) to support that claim.
For example in Russia King William of England is for some reason Willhelm.
Because Crimea was annexed by Russia, making Crimeans citizens of the RF, while West Bank is only occupied with Palestinians not having Isreali citizenship or equal rights.
People on reddit and in the west in general are incredibly cynical in regards to Russia and seem to think that Putin is everywhere and has his hand on the trigger pointed at everyone.
I probably wouldn't like driving even Toyota 4Runner, Ford Excursion sounds like a complete nightmare.
Haha, yeah, sorry for assuming, it's just not uncommon to see very strong and blind anti-Russian bias on Reddit
The only transgression the Russian singer is accused of is singing in Crimea after Russia's annexation.
Give land
How about French politicians and Russia?
(Please) Will someone translate this Russian text?
I think that at some point you have to start putting some responsibility on the Russian citizens because not only they elect Putin, they endorse Putin.
Others just seem too average for me to tell apart from a general location, like the south the north
but people do it indirectly, right
The Kremlin ties of really all of the nationalist parties are hair-raising in their implications.
I expect to become homeless very soon
They basically pretended that they trusted Russia, thus creating a dangerous precedent.
Hence one can trust that they won't cancel treaties that are bilaterally beneficial (e..g the gas for money thing).
It feels like the 1980s all over again.
It's as legitimate as asking the rebel commanders about the situation.
These two countries are already cooperating on something.
Like in many shops the records are fully watched only if anything extraordinary happens like a crime or even terrorist attack
I will check it out tomorrow, am on my way to a concert and not educated in Russian or even the alphabet.
I always started a conversation with a question "Do you speak Russian?"
They actively prepared and made alliances with the nazis to start the war.
Maybe because it's a huge stretch to say that this sum is a 'lot of money in Russia', if not an outright lie?
There is evidence of him leaving to tutor philosophy as far as Russia if I recall correctly.
I no longer take any pro Russian posts seriously.
This leads to racism, xenophobia and all sorts of hatred.
And don't forget the people: In this yuppy duppy new digitalized world you and me are able to talk easy each other, but many will have a problem to communicate in in Engliish.
They hate Russia almost as much as we do.
Also, it uses "i" when it formerly had "ѣ", and in this case it's kept in all forms ("хлiб/hlib" etc
So it's more like Putin declared the independence of Crimea rather than Crimea itself.
Clearly he was reading transcriptions written down in Cyrillic's.
Strip mass surveillance or social credit scores of any AI technology and what is actually left
Your anthem got its official status in 1889.
Russia merely supports a government with air strikes and limited activity, you cannot connect Russian support with Assad's will for total war.
After all, most of eastern Europe *is* in the EU, only Ukraine and Belarus are not.
Have in mind the fact, that not all ships US is having can swim into our little puddle and that it takes 3 weeks before the toys in the amount needed will reach Baltic.
Yes if it's the game of English origin
" I had to teach her that this doesn't sound polite at all
Never-mind the general strategical course Norway has taken since we joined in founding NATO.
But sometimes you can have a flight on the same distance for almost the same amount of money as a railroad trip
Keeping oil prices low is a priority, it makes it hard or impossible for Russia to make profit off its oil.
Russia: #Soviet_occupation_and_rise_of_the_Communists
I know that during my fathers time Soviet troops were invading our country when it became not subserviant enough and shooting civilians on street while secret police were dragging opponents to prisons, torturing them to death and iron curtain was lifted across the river and over 700 shot dead there.
The division was obvious and you can still see how undeveloped EE is compared to it's western neighbours, but on the other hand eastern EU countries significantly surpassed their eastern neighbours and are getting closer and closer to the west.
Yes they where maybe a little bit behind Europe from middle ages on, but that was mostly because everyone was(many important technologies just happened here at the time), and the greater the distance the more behind they where simply because new technologies like the printing press etc needed time to reach them.
Ahem, it was Russians muscling in on Sweden's territory first -or rather Novgorod since Russia as it's now understood didn't even exist before Muscovites conquered the rest of the principalities after 1500 and started waging their wars and constant expansion in expense of Tatars, polish, Sibirs and what not.
Put it as plain Latvian and Estonian?
If HDI mattered at all Russia would have not been part of it.
The number one target is Angela Merkel, who has been subjected to a “bombardment” of fake news over her refugee policy and support for economic sanctions against Russia.
Estonians and Russians in Estonia live more or less in two different societies.
The unusual diplomatic debut continued during an awkward encounter with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Also the Russian export market disappeared, on account of the sanctions, so demand went down significantly.
Alternatively, Putin accelerated Russia over the "rough path" stage so that it is already brightening.
It is not controlled by the Serbian government however, so no, Kosovo is not really Serbia.
Sweden currently spends 1/4 on its military (in percentage of GDP) compared to Russia (the only realistic threat the last 70-75 years), if Russia gets down to our current level (Russia's spending today is like Sweden's during the Cold War!) I think we could relax our military spending and "paranoia".
Cossacks
What brand is disproportionately popular in your country?
He he he
He showed a more moderate stance towards Russia during the presidential debates, yes, but lets see the facts - **half** of the right (or as you would call it liberal) party electorate (the pro-EU, pro-US, hard anti-Russian folks) voted for Radev.
Note that the Russians had orders to take Lubeck, which was past the agreed territorial split.
Didn't watch it much but it seemed to be fairly good quality.
They also replaced 'the Russia is a multi ethnic state' to 'the russians are state forming ethnos' in constitution this summer
I meant that it's more subtle in Russia – they don't put the whole picture in the headline, they often use comparisons and associations to make a point, and only then they start to call names and stuff
The Russians are financing it too.
Well France is the worser one as its a bigger country but I'm hopeful.
Aphantasia exists, y’know
You must realize that wars are waged differently pre-WW2 and post-WW2.
NATO would not do so, even if only because it is not a nation.
I would like to say Eesti, but since i started to listening their rap it became less wierd,so id say Turkish
My country suffered enough at the hands of Russia to trust any pinky-swear-promises they might give.
I don't think that happens now because there's more control over it lately
Since both Russian and ukrainian are eastern Slavic, people think they have to be simmilar, while they are really not.
however, there's still very little anti EU sentiment or pro Russia sentiment within our politics.
But right now YOU help Putin to stay in power.
Edit: typo
We only got invaded after deciding to not follow Russias course.
I know there is a connection with Russia, but especially China is really strange.
I think you understand how bad this is
Because of Syria who knows what can happen,because we support the side who opposes Turkey and we have ultimately conflicting interests in some areas and sharing the border there,last time our jet was downed we had sanctions and threats on our TV,furthermore there is Armenia and if Azerbaijan and them will have a conflict then it means that Turkey will join which means there is a possibility of clashes between us and turkish soldiers
By somebody turning upside down the Russian flag, true story bro
Second, Russian salad is Czech, we all know that.
For one, I'm pretty sure that many people in the eastern Ukraine are pro-Russian, but mostly Russia can't allow the EU to come that close to them.
Welcome to the Internet, abandon all hope of a nuanced and educated discussion at the door please, that k you
Too many people in his inner circle have shown ties to Russia.
But it really seems like one of the first times Russia is getting major positive results with their western propaganda.
He's anti-gay adoption of babies conceived artificially, he won't overturn the law on gay marriage.
Then there's some confusion in regards to Bosnia too, maybe not that much in terms of accepted scientific history, but more like "it is known" general knowledge that depends on whom you ask.
I don't even want to imagine what could possibly go wrong.
Author's biography explains it all.
Well in 1945 Russia stole some of our territories in Eastern Estonia and yes there is still a slight dispute.
If Russia wants to build settlements in Ukraine why not just let them annex the whole of Ukraine and make Ukrainians citizens of Russia?
If Russia takes over Europe, the UK is next
From [this surrealistic set] taken from [the Ostankino tower]
He is not a head anymore, he is some another body part now.
England kills more people with the NHS each year than the Russians do with live ammo.
The fact that more troops (mostly American) are stationed in Eastern Europe now than any time during the Cold War, the fact that every news outlet treats Russia like a rogue state that's constantly interfering in European affairs and the fact that Russia annexed the Crimea not very long ago.
I would rather choose a country with good combination of culture and nature regardless of economical benefits.
Single shot is usually enough to remove the turret from the target vehicle.
And we also use patronymic so future kids will have it weird: Alexander Svyatopolkovich, etc
Once the Russians obliterate you and you obliterate them any country will be able to move in an seize your territories.
Just why
I’m so grateful that I learned English back then just because it’s an international language and the whole world speaks English
Those then declared the independence after Germanys failed attempt to establish a United Baltic Dutchy.
Estonia had a Baltic German upper class throughout the Swedish, Polish and Russian era and Estonian is influenced by German vocabulary (and I presume expressions) [a lot]
I mean the context always matters, she is definitely not Nazi sympathizer, and the show is totally not serious, it was definitely just a joke for her.
Guess they still are a super power if they are causing all this.
Come on Iceland, get yourself together    /s
True, but the only people who's talking about its possible secession are a few brain-dead "liberals" who have no relation to Finnic culture.
The goals are different in both cases.
Then let's write all the Roman generals and colonialists of America in the ranks of the madmen
Just look at [how Germany prioritized Austria-Hungary over Russia which lead to the Entente] That quote was made in a certain global milieu with the backdrop of extreme realpolitik and imperialism.
That's what you have compromised machines for.
They did it with Russia because the issue was international in nature, Turkey's problems are internal.
I've noticed they tend to be cheaper, though I still avoid them like the plague
You are right, let's hope you would never do it again.
No in the sense that we have have always felt the tension with Russia.
Sorokin is by far the best contemporary Russian writer, so it's impossible to give a short description here.
you keep calling them Russians, although at that particular moment of history they had their own identity.
She knew of this for years but until yesterday was still describing the story as misinformation from the Russians and she has made a career out of portraying her family as WWII victims.
Russia opposition leader Navalny says Kremlin sabotaging his presidential bid
This is such a shitty representation.
In Russia 40€ per 1000 km should be a pretty fair deal , if you have the ability to put up with three more neighbors in a train compartment , and 115€ if you wanna have just one more interlocutor in the room except your own self
Ukraine won't have a choice, Russia can always revise the agreement.
Of course it he would took over Ukraine with significant polish help he might be more or less dependent on Poland but not so much to call him a puppet.
So the rest of Russia is just forehead?
If you really want to piss off Russians you should change USSR to Russian Khanate or exclude it altogether
Actually, it is almost the same place
Lend-Lease made Russian counterattacks possible.
And no one meddles in other people's business (if it does not harm your interests)
In our age it's easy to check any standard number using smartphone.
Russia is the successor state of the USSR.
We tracked the Russian flotilla recently for thousands of miles.
It's not epic and way sad
I would really like to have a universal IT-based system to catch all thèse corrupted politicians
There would be no coming back from such a breach of confidence.
Russian people are more likely to be pro-USA than pro-Iran/DPRK, for even Putin can't sell that shit w/o people scratching their heads.
Putin can force our leaders to sign anything he wants.
You couldn't even liberate yourselves from the Ottomans without Russia's crucial assistance and the advent of the Russo-Turkish War, and you claim you liberated the entire Balkan Peninsula.
I'm sure there are many cities, but Cologne was one of the most boring cities outside Russia for me so far
and EU member don't forget, big no no
It's one thing to be in NATO and be guaranteed.
It's a shitshow
When I was a kid, only the hosting parents would stay with us or sometimes we'd be completely on our own
And those were no artichokes
One of Putin's policy planks is nationalism
Wouldn't really guess that considering the economic performance.
If it's true then changes your ways, if it's not then counter it with truth.
For a long periods of time the eastern ends of Europe were more progressive and advanced than their western counterparts, for many of those that time ended with the coming of your ancestors.
No, not really
I guess I used a wrong word, I haven't watched it yet.
Russia is home to like 100+ ethnic groups
I prefer the version that it was just stupid resources management
Yea, that's why the professors in Higher School of Economics (one of the top two economic universities in Russia) openly preach Maidan-style overthrow of Putin and still go on teaching.
I wonder why any Eastern European nation would ever fear Russia.
It is quite clear that a lot of countries under this type of rule are suffering economical problems and people are not getting better.
It does scare me a little bit, because by all accounts they got the shit bits of both the Middle East and Russia (which is one hell of a combo, really), but I'm still so curious, the culture must be so interesting (even if it isn't necessarily in a good way)
I don't know does it counts, because this city in asian part of Russia, but Russia is still European country so
So it's pretty convenient
Russia never been interested in being part of Europe Union, they are very nationalistic, and culturally they are there own thing.
Or, a tape appears where she states that she actually isn't anti-EU, she just sees the EU as a fall guy to get votes from "those idiots who really believe all that crap".
It's fearmongering to suggest that this "build up" is anything notable.
Eastern Europeans, what is the state of your country's relationship with Russia?
Lol, that kind make Russia look far smaller..
Would you also call Ukrainian and Belarusian mentally/culturally Asian countries if Russia is one?
There is not a reason for them to like Russia.
Russian bank with a 20 million portfolio gave FN 10 million (in other words 50% of their working capital) where other much bigger banks didn't find her creditworthy.
I did fight alongside Russian volunteers in Bosnia.
How do they say brown nose in Russian?
How far the links between YPG and PKK are is at least debatable, YPG at least claim to be independent.
And the one time where ukraine had to pay 400% more over night for gas.
Anyone who isn't radical pro-Putin or anti-Trump expected this to happen at some point.
I bet you used the money on mandatory Russian language classes...
I don't know man, many times it feels like people are really trying hard to harm the national identity of Romanians.
>  because of Stalin that Hitler was able to reach the heights that he did
Well if you compare USSR's and Lithuania's economies..
Russian is very useful in Eastern Europe, and anywhere else where the Russians has been historically
Where exactly lay the borders of Europe, the continent.
Tried that, doesn't work, any other tips
We have Finland, should be enough to deter any Russian threat.
Russian and Porruguese have very similar phonetics
Russians used to be such devoted communism builders and yet now vast majority define themselves as god-fearing Orthodox believers.
Here in the Netherlands we don't use Russian, but we can hear it on tv on a regular basis.
Now compare it with ordinary life in the West.
People keep their heads down and worry about themselves and their families
You **could** conclude (albeit incorrectly) that due to both Germany and Russia being in favor of Nord Stream they are therefore allies, though it takes more to be considered allies than having **one** mutual economical interest.
Indeed, every time someone points out a correlation between a group of people and a particular trait, someone like you, for some reason, feels the need to point out the obvious - hence the pedantry - and remind us about how not all Russians support Puting or whatever, even though no sane person would take that position.
The whole borderland bullshit is invented by fuckheads who can't see difference between U/V and O letters.
Britain for example and all European countries must not close their eyes and turn into introverts while war is raging at their doorsteps.
Fuck your so called friendship
What’s the deal with writing the name of your country in a different language
You are a right wing loon because you are trying to delegitimize the correct claim that Russia was involved in manipulating elections.
I still have a positive image of Scottish people though and I'm neutral about Welsh and Northern Irish (?) people, because I don't know much about them.
From what I got: People feared for their jobs..
Turkey and Russia are not so bad in comparison.
I have never said that democracy is not suitable for Asia.
Germans remain stupid as always.
Banning something has only made things worse every time someone has tried it.
Also the Russians are considered communists.
She used her numerous ladies-in-waiting to test drive and rate prospective bedmates, with the final test being her closest confidante
If even the USSR has failed with that bridge, then how on Earth that thug state they call Russia will succeed?
This is Putin's favorite "geopolitical philosopher", with a lot of influence at the very top of the Russian government.
Western Propaganda
Ukraine themselves can hold against Russia and that is because it is a lot harder to attack than it is to defend.
Пхахаха is a common way to express laughter in Russian
Putin had to extend term length from 4 to 6 years to postpone the next flip-flop.
This cat is in jail for coup attempt.
They did not comment on other countries.
all the comments use similar terminology and push the same agenda - true or not.
I doubt they'd declare war on Russia and send in troops, but they'd probably give other kind of support like intel and equipment.
They've bargained large autonomies despite having a Russian ethnic majority, who were against independence.
The EU should keep sanctions on Russia regardless of what the US does or does not do.
Russian bias, Stalinium armor pls fix.
I'm shocked Czech Republic is higher than Spain.
Ukraine is kind of a special case because It has never fully escaped Russia's sphere of influence.
Our trade with them didn't follow the principles of market economy which meant that we were completely unprepared for the collapse of the Soviet Union (see: [The Finnish Great Depression: From Russia with Love]
Majority negative results
Because if they didn't everyone would assume Russia.
Of the 690,000 men that invaded Russia, only 93,000 returned.
This has been underestimated by many western forces in the last decade and that's why they are trying to catch up.
Pretty sure most Russian hooligans live in Russia and not central London.
Nah man, I don't know about the Bulgarian dude, but Dodon is as pro-Russian as it gets, he even used pictures with Putin during the campaign.
>The minute you let her under your skin
I think a fair share of Russia's wealth is in the UK.

Much more people fled from Assad than from ISIS.
It could do that without spending over 2%.
You can be black listed by the government or fined/thrown in jail
You'd rather live in a mudhole just as long as Russia is "strong and independent".
Great Patriotic War is what foreigners call it.

What's heat
Even though populists are gaining popularity all across Europe, they are financially weak.
There are already enough conflicts with Russia, especially now that its perfectly possible that we are going to lose the biggest actor in the NATO.
Schröder Plan was to build a more independent (from the USA) Europe, so he tried to get along with Russia (for god sake we have to get along with those guys they are our neighbors even we don't realy like there policy that much and gas export is the best "gift" you can give them).
Do people remember Russian biochemical regiment being deployed to Italy

We traditionally have two layers of curtains for that, for example
Why we shouldn't be able to return to our homeland and live there, especially while so many Circassians got stuck in the middle of the Syrian Civil War, the one that Russia is an active actor of?
Ok come here I have plenty of them
Thing is, the Bolsheviks didn't replace the Czar's Empire, they replaced [the Republic] that has [overthrown] the Empire.
The Ukraine was a part of Russia for a long long time, and writers and singers are plentiful and of quality.
Russia has almost the same percentage of Orthodox Christians as Romania, I wouldn't call them atheists.
Durning one of many Polish-Russia wars, Russian officer ask Polish soldier, why he fight.
If this jackass Newt Gingrich said something like this amidst developing events of a Russian takeover in Estonia, there would be a lot of public backlash at Newt.
The idea is that if Russia were to invade, then troops from every NATO country would die and all countries would be involved.
Irony
Exactly what Russia has been doing for almost a century.
All I remember from last year was a male friend I made in the UK [sending me this] with a winking emoji
Hello.I read about Scandinavians knowing English by importing lots of Englis speaking media.
How much someone feels part of any given nation is a very personal matter.
I agree, but the pararells is that during WWII the West had to ally with the Soviet Union as they had one common enemy.
dammit I forgot about that, as most countries denied the defence system until Russia became the enemy again.
They made jokes about my learning with the girls a couple of times, but mostly they would be friendly and say things like "it's great that at least you don't have to do that shit" or something along those lines
But honestly, if I heard a foreigner say any of these albeit a bit wrong, I'd be so impressed and probably very confused that I wouldn't even notice it
The fact that there are liberals in Turkey doesn't make Turkey liberal.
War is much more than production, though, but yeah, unless Russia makes a crippling first strike using nukes or something, woken Germany alone would not be a pushover.
Saudi Arabia spends more than Russia yet they are shit.
If Russia wants to give back siberia and crimea, and kalingrad, etc you can say it was temporary but honestly most countries lost many of their colonies too.
They are ethnically mostly Russian, they are militarily backed by Russia, and they want to join Russia.
But Poles are evil and mortal enemies, blood of people calls to be avenged and war is a must, so Taras says "I spawned you - and I will end you too" and does just that
And even if you yanks left Europe, you would still be forced to help us through NATO.
No one, Turkey and Russia are to big.
It's just become a stage for America's power projection ambitions, and for spats between the US and Russia.
Russian students can go to one of Russia's universities.
Russia and US do that for example.
you cannot connect Russian support with Assad's will for total war.
While there are no false statements in your comment -- indeed, there was a war, and Bolsheviks had to throw away their idea that workers of every nation would help them fight the bourgeoisie in future wars, -- your comment creates an impression that the warmongering USSR attacked Poland, while it was the other way around
When you go from Narva to Ivangorod, cars become more expensive, while everything else around you becomes shittier.
Yes, Russia used private contractors (mercenaries) against ISIS in Palmyra.
It's not "slow and dumb", it's slow to show emotions or come forth with additional information
Your motto is "Je maintaindrai" but you will only maintain with Frances' help.

These lands were added to Russian territory during the Soviet period just like Crimea was added to Ukraine.
Russia benefits greatly from a weak Europe.
Get your shit together Czechs and Hungarians
With other NATO countries criticising Italy for accepting Russian help but also not sending them any of the help from EU
That basically means Latvians overwhelmingly voted against Russian, and some Russian-speakers voted against, too (if you do the math with Russian speaking citizens and non-citizens - who we can assume all speak Russian - then we can come to the conclusion that not all Russian-speaking citizens voted as a bloc "for" national-language status of Russian).
Absolutely amazing movie, at first it looks like a shitty mafia drama, but it's much more
Without Russia, they would have a choice.
I could imagine France using their usual "that's totally not a colony" trick, but where do your reefs grow?
Their bringing corrupt politicians, they're bringing violators of human rights…and some, I assume, as good people.
I am saying what is commonly accepted in Russia, we don't label people based on ethnicity, we consider everyone who has been assimilated into our culture Russian, even if they clearly have some different ethnic background.
On paper it is Russian company owned by a Russian, but in reality the capital, management, employees, trade partners and clients are Chinese
It seems to be a real game changer that turns France from the world capital of hostility to a very warm and sociable place

I like to think that a Russian guy was the founder of such a huge company and everyone uses it everyday
All those things you mention became better under Putin though.
When I talked with some of them here in Belgium they are all pro Putin, defend Russia all the time but they escaped their own country when they had the chance and they have zero intentions to go back.
Add regular russian army - around 5000 killed.
Probably a bit less than Russia.
It tends to suggest their media might not be the most trustworthy.
Others they wanted to destroy and did everything to destroy them.
Well, they do the military service for 6-11 months when they are young, and after that they go on with their lives and studies and careers.
He explains that since the cold war the USA's military focus was directly or by proxy mainly targeted at Russia, that Trump wants to shift that focus to China, that the very powerful intelligence agencies disagree with Trump on the matter, that having US troops and covert intelligence operatives in Europe when the US are so unstable is dangerous, and that as a result we (the EU/France) should treat with Russia independently without US interference.
I'm still waiting
However I wouldn't want my country to get back there if Russia would implode today.
It is true that Romania existed before.
Russia I guess, although I don't really hate them or anything.
In turn, today's Russia would have been smaller, but perhaps more prosperous and equal in terms of wealth.

I often (no, really) wonder how things might've turned out had Novgorod at least survived, and in the best case scenario actually even united Russia in the manner that Muscovy ended up doing.
Until mainstream politicians don't pull their heads out of their asses about immigration, half of your points are impossible, it's like a Domino.
Where I live, there's a marketplace where older immigrants from former USSR countries (Latvia, Kazakhstan etc.) work and they all communicate in Russian.
A lot of people moved all over the country during the Soviet times, plus the spread of TV with standardized Russian.
- "tell/call/help to someone", because they all take dative in Russian, like "talk"
Most of parties in GUE/NGL are old-way, Russia-friendly communists, somehow I can't imagine most of party members (or voters) happy with this choice.
It made no Sense for us to got involved, and Merkels "Invitation" has cost us dearly already.
Russian leadership is a a bunch of wankers.
Blue Ranger's original actor was gay and ostracized for it.
It is the only way for people of countries like Baltics to feel themselves used by they friends as a shield which would be destroyed first in case of conflict with completely other countries.
Russia is too big and too diverse for a unified opposition throughout the whole country imo.

Nada happens because they buy their way into UN committees.
Instead I try to read as much as possible.
One of my favourite decades, in fact.
I remember an article from twenty years ago that indicated that Germany would be able to get nukes in six months to a year, as all plans and material were already available.
Of course, the "referendum" they had was absurd, as conducted already in an occupied territory and with far-right or other pro-Russian "observers".
So is the Russia one actual suicides or "suicides" ;^)
The border between Europe and Asia is drawn along tectonic plate boundaries after all.
Ukrainian has much more in common with Russian.
He represents what Russia always wanted to be: strong, healthy and independent
He should speak Russian like MLP.
There was a reason why even openly anti-Russian elements fought alongside with Abkhazians even if many actually love Georgia.
We all know that if it wasn't for other countries Germany would have destroyed Russia in WW2 (even if they didn't launch a full attack in russia).
Wich Nation first came into the middle east with warships, tanks, and fighter jets, and created a hell on earth to begin with?
What is going on behind the scenes is the only thing that really matters.
Especially after that whole "Russian girl getting raped by evil foreigners and ze Germans covering it up and allowing it" bs that had their pet monkey Lavrov foaming at the mouth.

Now it's lower than them because of low oil prices.
I'm telling you that you have top ranked Swedish people working there because they are good at their jobs and they work there despite Sweden not being in NATO, it's got nothing to do with Sweden being a member or not.
but almost everywhere at a day time
You do understand that you sound exactly like the worst examples of Putin propaganda?
Perhaps a similar useless buildup, but they won't cross that line without some sort of domestic pretext like with Georgia and Ukraine which would come through information warfare first.
A minor one, like contracting less than 1% if I am correct.
Open the paywalled article and copy the headline of the article.
Look at UK it can't be 130 currently in any way, they are like in a total lockdown
But I can assure you that Russian government has no interest in conquering the world.
They still refuse to rank the Russian city "higher" than the American St.
Not a European one
Greece, Belgium and every other country are looking to buy F-35.
Most Russians I met are nice people, I don't think we should judge a whole group of people based off one comment.
Is it legal to send armed forces into a sovereign country to oversee the annexation of territory through a spontaneous referendum?
Of course details are changing but I am speaking of general approaches.

I'm all itching for [Turkish Straits crisis] 2: Islamic Boogaloo.
But that's also better than Western Russia.
Participant political culture implies not only that citizens are capable of changing country's leadership by legal means, but also that those citizens do understand important features that differ one talking figure head in the TV from another one
But when you think about conflicts outside Europe, USA is often involved in so many, especially when compared to other powers that are mostly involved only regionally.
It's not a negligible amount of money, but it's nowhere close enough to be considered "a lot".
It's incredible if this was American / Russian, it'd be on FP with 100% upvotes, but it's talking negative about realities of big business in Europe..
You can't say anything with a Russian flair without people mentioning it to you.
Again he views Russia as the old home land before Stalen.
The Soviet state failed and collapsed due to incompetent mismanagement while sitting on trillions of natural resources.
Well, I've seen Americans compare Swedish to Russian, so let's count them out of this, okay?
Former Eastern EU leaders warn Trump on Russia
Even though the US is a big ally, of course someone also there must think that if Europe becomes a power like themselves, they would lose influence in some parts of the world, but also at the same time they would get a way stronger ally.
I always presumed the sentiment was a lot more prevalent than in the UK.
Trump has indicated he might not honour the treaty if member states are attacked who have not 'paid their way', will accept the annexation of the Crimea and will likely drop sanctions on Russia.
As you can see, the vast majority of the comments are from Austrians, so it's clear enough for me, that they are more touched with this subject.
What makes you think it wasn't Russia if we are going to assume foul play?
Ask yourself, what happened in Europe that people like Le Pen are serious candidate?
So all your colleagues are likely to be women, and whenever you have a birthday they are likely to come up with "let's sing 'Accountant' to him

Hasn't the real income of an average Russian gone up like 10x since 1991?
While this is true to some degree, this all happened in a time when *everyone* was an asshole and Sweden pretty graciously let go of us and there is no threat of them trying to take us back.
They're not much less delusional from your average Russ.
However, it seems quite a bit of the rest of the world disagrees with you.
As /u/mil_cord points out, it goes "where do you think you are between the best and worst possible life for you?" People here don't often think about Africa/Middle East aside from "death, destruction, hunger" etc, while for example Ukraine will probably spend a lot of time looking at Russia, the rest of Europe etc.
R stands for Republics, not Russia.

Pine forests, sand dunes, clear sea and oil rigs on the horizons
The difference is that people in Baltics never wanted to be part of USSR.
I'm still not sure Russia has the capacity to do that nowadays though.
Look at the embarrassment English and Russian fans were in France.
I dunno how how long ago we started doing it, but we did it in USSR times to
Most likely not, but yeah, the most recent case of vandalising Jewish cemeteries in Latvia (several years ago) turned out to be a bunch of Russian "anti-fas", in their own words, "trying to attract the world's attention to the rise of nazism in Latvia".

We mostly learn about the holocaust and not about a whole lot else.
So even in Russian, it is wrong to put a comma after an adjective in that particular case
I don't think Russia will make a move either, but I honestly just suspected that someone who thinks that the EU states won't come to aid in case of a russian invasion, would think of such an invasion be fairly likely.

I'm surprised people here are surprised by Turkey's action and Western "non-action". Turkey together with other its NATO and gulf allies has been destabilizing Syria for the last 7 years with one clear purpose: to destroy Syria as a country
Russian Disney dubbing > Polish Disney dubbing.

Well, technically he was right.
if Russia ever wanted to "take back" countries that were occupied by Soviets they would do it before these nations joined NATO?
Well it's not like Russia is an avid supporter of any kind of European unity at the moment, unless they get to be in charge.
There is no way those cities could ever be considered Asian.

Russia wants to break up NATO because it is scared of itself being attacked by a military alliance 15 times its size.
Whereas for them it seems like there is no perception about it other than stereotypes, we actually both interact with Russians and live in comparable conditions.
Don't worry Greece, at least you can help pay for it and then when your country is ground into the dirt and your people are starving they will make willing soldiers for the inevitable war with Russia or China, they can even read Cyrillic!

Do you have some references for that?
It would push back Russia, bomb some of its infrastructures but try to limit its incursions to some determined limit (which one I don't know).
They can spend their entire budget and it still will be less than what Russia spends solely on military.
It is funny to watch at people who try to make it look like a joke.
You seem to be dodging the questions.
In fairness, Germany caused a hell of a lot of bloodshed in its early years.
That's right
I live on Kuusinen street in Moscow lol
Many people in the West think that the Soviet Union is as evil as Nazi Germany and they don't even think that the SU saved Europe by sacrificing millions of people

Ukraine, Georgia and Syria were their puppet states, they had full control of all three governments and had military bases all over the place.
Exposure shouldn't serve Russian interests.
And we've seen that when Putin starts losing popularity, and thus power, he invades another country.

Daesh aren't illiterate goatherders with AKs, they are a highly weaponised professional military force.
Russia to 'expand mobile nuclear missile patrols' near European borders in 2017
As much as I appreciate people trying out new languages, in 9/10 cases it's easier to switch to English than try to understand what someone is trying to say in what they think is Ukrainian or Russian.
Turkey isn't going to stop feeding the religious/nationalist frenzy anytime soon so stuff like this will keep happening and the Russians *will* lose their cool the third, fourth or fifth time.

NATO desperately needs Russia to exist.
Russian government is impressive.

In Russian it's Germania but Nemci, while in Ukrainian it's Nimci and Nimechchina (yeah, double ch).
Do you think the EU can fight a trade war with the UK and the Trump led US at the same time, plus dealing with Russia sans NATO?
Pretty sure even fictional names get transcribed with -ия
>economic factors
During WWII they lost around 40 million people, they haven't recovered from that, actually, they won the war against Germany, I have no idea why Stalin did not wiped out Germany entirely for what they did to Russia (or the USSR).
But if Ukraine had been in NATO they would not have been attacked.
Well it is important to note that trump would not have been elected either, should he not received help from Russia.
If Russia officially invades, Ukraine might just surrender.
Czechia and Slovenia are very friendly towards Russia.

Seems to be playing into Putin's hands...

Getting in was a bit of an ordeal - having the contents of my backpack search, long lines in customs, etc.
Every official assumes his higher up is lying for public image and 'wrong' voting results would still get them in trouble.
He agreed

Religious and ethnic parties are forbidden in Russia.
Palestine isn't shown as part of Israel (**on this map**), so Crimea shouldn't be shown as part of Russia.

Talk about stuck between a rock and a hard place.
If you want to actually go into Crimea you will need a Russian visa and possibly some extra permissions.

There wasn't Salafism/Wahhabism in Caucasus before Russia massacred 10% of the Chechen population and bombed all the country to the ground including it's economy.
You have to understand it's a country with a very rich and unique history, but most of it is built on nationalism/imperialism.
There's no way Russia should be that small.
The only thing that Russia has to do in this case is just to persuade others that this will be "the last time".
I’ve had this problem in other countries as well
Ivan Ivanovich, a great Russian man^^^^nequin
Why can't Russians do this shit to each other somewhere in Siberia?
You have a very well defined group who thinks you deserve death for speaking against them
And state-directed economics was a traditional thing in 19-century of Russia.
And here you are saying that only the Russian army has lost 30K.
If we're forcing them to choose between 'us' and 'them', they might easily go for the latter.
Well I would lie if I say I wouldn't like to see a united human race.
Couldn't find statistics of death indirectly caused by alcohol
You're not post Soviet, you just have victim complex + self aggrandizement
For example in Russia she made a very pompous "look, we saved this kid, we're so generous" actions that of course received commendation from president himself.
Putin’s enormous palace in Southern Russia

Albania and Bosnia are both poorer from memory
He was dead politician long before he became dead man
But if your window is on some high floor with no buildings around or in the middle of private garden, that's another situation
In fact you can see similar things in Russia and I do not think we are expecting Russia to collapse.
This is awesome
Yeah i used to follow because I thought western media was really harsh towards Russian culture but after Trump won I just couldn't take the posts there were going on around there.
I visited Kiev/Chernobyl and Odessa in May 2015.
Putin: Russian aggression is ‘a myth’
Oh please, you can find lots of photos, made by civilians, of Russian equipment in Donbass, no one is going to guide you by hand to show something what everyone knows for a long time.
In February 2015, **a poll by German polling firm GfK** revealed that attitudes have not changed.
That’s it
Their "estimates" of real estate ownership are laughable and evidently wrong.
So let me get this straight, Russia send jets to test their defenses, sends warships to do the same, then complains when they won't refuel their ships?
I think Norwegians do as well
So one can say "Я стар, я просто суперстар", that will mean "I am old, I am just a superstar".
Considering that Lithuania did produce more Russia exports, and that Finland has approx 5 times the land area, Lithuania lost much more due to the embargo.
We've done a **TON** of shady shit for the wrong reasons.
About the guns - they are two options why they actually wanted it - they are afraid of their own citizens or to boost black market sells.
Shipka and majority of the figthing had already been done when Serbia joined.They saw who would win and used the oppurtunity for occupying Pirot and Vranq(cities with Bulgarian majority at the time) and declaring independence.In no way they deserve thanks as they had fewer casualties than obscure battalions in the Russian army like Polish or Finnish ones and did everything for their own profit.
For starters, the BBC including that quote out of context is just shit journalism on its part, considering it wasn't said at the event.
Well, Russia is sending soldiers to Syria but wants to hide it.
It will take a lot of work to persuade people in the EU that Ukrainian accession is a good idea.
He's talking about people with anti-Russian agendas in these places, not those places in general.
Родина-мать - motherland of our kin or something like that
The painting was a reaction to the actions of Czar Nikolai II and a form of passive resistance.
that's true, and I'm not defending it, my main point was that the recent two WW losses, and the Russian occupation have had such a bad effect that it's prettymuch caused this severe nation-wide depression, which somehow spreads to the newer generations too, and needs to be cured somehow
But that doesnt count since Turkey isent europe.
This state would break Europe out of the orbits of the United States and Russia, and become a powerful player on the world stage.
People also noticed that Babchenko's last post in Facebook (he wrote that it was his second birthday, that exactly 4 years ago he didn't get a seat in a helicopter that was shot down) looked like a setup for faked death -- and it was true in the end
Using it on a nearly daily basis.
what will Russia gain from invading country X
That's why they were so harsh in their reaction
I'd say physical punishment to children
But don't let me stop you trying to spread hysteria.

All the Serbs singing praises to their beloved Russia more than make up for the missing Russians.
Pick the language that will be useful for you in the future.
We have no problems with Russia.
I wanted to say exactly the same thing about Russian
Russia has supported and nurtured far-right movements that brought about Brexit and Trump, they are also shoveling money and support to other European far-right nationalist parties such as the French National Front party, which was founded by Nazi collaborators and apologists, the German AfD party which according to one of its former founders Bernd Lucke has been infiltrated by racists and fascists, and many others around Europe, in addition to far-left movements like Syriza in Greece.

Not isolating yourself to a tiny regional country of the size of Bohemia with giant Russia all over the east.
I think you may have just awakened a dragon by calling Poland the Eastern European country :D
went to Moscow and St Petersburg last year, for some reason I really like Russia and their culture a lot.
They don't like democracy, which was born, and is prevalent throughout, basically all of Europe (except you Belarus and Russia)
That's preferred method of dealing with corrupted officials and nouveau riches
Annexing bordering land and an openly hostile and anti-Western government should already ring the alarm bells.
Some songs from European Russia:
Was, it was my (Russia's) vassal and I annexed it :)
Okay THAT ti

Well, actually is NATO that started it by placing long range missiles pointed towards Russia in their eastern European countries as "defence measure".
I just stubbed my toe I swear I saw a Russian spy running off just after.
Oh shit, the mosquitoes
Why do we have to give money to Russia or Middle East countries when paying a bit more we canbe energetically autonomous?
Not pictured - NATO's super ABM defence with the ability to shoot down 100% of Russia's ICBMs during ascent stage.
Calling European diplomacy "where we settled difficult thinks" is hilarious.
It's time for the EU to leave NATO behind and their interventionist behavior and focus on an army for defense instead of provocation.
I just wear my usual pants, a warm winter coat, a scarf, and I cover my head with the hood
“Russia has been mistreated by the EU and its vassal France,” she said.
They send there secretly groups of people that destabilize region and a lot of pro-russia people actually help them intentionally or not (and that all was in the moment when there was maidan and country was in chaos plus Crimea event).
Four Russian military advisors killed in Syria
The FN has received questionable loans from Russian banks.

Soviet/Russian dominance in Eastern Europe and Central Asia ended with internal fracturing and some "minor" (as in not continent-wide) wars.
Yes referencing the word "Russia"
As long as Russia still has these basic three things, it can still be relevant and catch up.
You can see it if you look at the historical values of the report at page 202.
Labeling someone as a brainwashed putin troll for reading RT is totally wrong.
Their whole game must be to turn the public against him, undermine him at every turn, and then...
Tell that to the millions of victims of Russian bloodlust and Bolshevism.
The former is really ugly and should be just demolished, and the latter, while not ugly, is still irrelevant, and should be replaced by a statue to someone relevant, and the square renamed
I was called a Nazi without any factual evidence just an hour ago - I'd prefer if we didn't stoop down to the level of those infested by Russian propaganda.
Since you know, when Russia unleashed conquest campaign of North Caucasus, only Dagestan was Muslim and others were multi-religious lands whose Muslims are rather Sufi pseudo-Muslims with Christian and pagan traditions, or ones doesn't know much to practice anything.
Should've anschlussed Russia back when we actually made it to the Kremlin several hundred years ago :P
Both our fringe parties - the Left and the AfD - are pretty tight with Russia, and they've gained support over the last year.
The Germans needed both for defence which explains its paranoid foreign policy facilitating a naval arms race with Britain and a War Plan with no plan for recourse.
(it's weird to phrase in English, I know) And doubled it for 2+. Before you got financial help and some privileges if you had 2 or more children, now even 1 gives you some of those which is nice
How can you agree with "there was no invasion" when everyone, including the Russian government, says that there were Russian troops involved?
I think a paper in a respected French journal like *Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France* or *Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences* should suffice
We have no problems with migrants that act normally.
I think problem lies deeper than only Erdogan craziness.
Some Americans will blame Russians for this.
but don't give me shit like: Russians are banned from fueling in Malaga but they can in Cueta, cause you know we are frustrated with Nato but we don't have the courage to speak our minds.
If you are not going to back up your claim, that is ok to not make any at all
Given enough time, Moldovan will be closer to Russian than Romanian.
Does this mean Russia will end its imperialistic tendencies towards Ukraine?
However, there are stations with only Russian-language music.
Also pre Russia-Ukraine conflict, though.
If you get bored easily, it might not be for you, but personally, I loved it, and would do it again in a heartbeat.
Yeah, and there´s a camp in Lapland where Russian children are taken and taught to be gays.
So no direct conflict but lots of disagreements and cold relations.
The Donbass is another question all together, I think Ukraine might (hopefully) be able to get that back.
I tried Russian, because it just sounds so distinct.
That be too much of a hassle if I was only visiting for a couple days.
it has nothing to do with immigration, only with opportunities.
The Ottoman Turks had a justified fear that the Armenians were becoming more and more aligned with the Russian Empire.
Million Millionaires in Moscow happily living with hundred million of low class peasants that happily do whatever their ruling class says....
I would call you stupid, but you appear to be too thick to understand such a term, and I'll not engage you further.
We have five spaceports on Russian territory:
You don't get how imperialism is still ingrained to the Russian mentality.
No panic buying because of a coronavirus but likely there will be panic buying because of RUB/USD exchange rates (ruble tumbled by 5% currently) after OPEC+ oil-deal failure
Yeah we'll just have Great Patriotic War billboards everywhere
One guy at a train station actually spat on the floor and asked me not to speak Russian to him again, that's when I realised people may have different feelings about what a given language means to them.
In addition to the US, UK, Russian, Chinese, Turkish, etc., intelligence services, that makes 27 more intelligence services that may spy on the EU, but still not a single counterespionage unit for defending the EU.
Better go free the Russian minority!
Comparing art on the basis of technical difficulty seems extremely narrow-minded.
Coz Germanic languages are much simpler than Slavic ones.
How Russia Weaponizes Fake News
What do you do with its millions of tiny bones?

He is suggesting ethnic cleansing to get rid of Russians, despicable in my opinion.
And was heavily and rightfully so criticized for it by the most of the countries in the world.
Those on board included Russian servicemen and artists from a musical ensemble who were on their way to celebrate the upcoming New Year with the Russian air force at the Hmeimin air base in Syria, RIA also quoted the Defence Ministry as saying.
Sitting in the streets in mobs, drinking, smoking, spitting, harassing women.
Oh I definitely agree on the breakdown being important.
I'm sure if Russia reported their stats, those would be included too.
In my school, a lot of kids chose Russian as their second foreign language, basically to fuck around and do nothing since a lot of them were already Russian speakers and the others were expected to pick it up naturally outside of school.
This is the funniest thing ever.
Maybe I indeed didn't express myself clearly and I admit that
The order that I suspect most people would jump to defend this countries is probably Somalia, Afghanistan, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, North Korea, China, and then depending on where you are its a toss up between the US and Russia.
Capital punishment was abolished in Russia in 1997, as one of the key conditions for joining the Council of Europe
The Democrats lost and their base can't even accept that fact so they keep crying "Russia this, Russia that".
You would get the same message only waste some more of the global energy to pass a heavier image
Also Kurds can get away with openly protesting TUR Govt.
About a month ago I've read a post on r/tifu where a guy forgot the word "celery" in a restaurant and had to describe his order as "green crunchy sticks" while looking and feeling pretty dumb (in his words)
Unlikely

He doesn't buy Russian disinformation.
Nah, Finland was invented by the Russians and the Japanese to scam fishing quota /r/finlandconspiracy

If it was for u/h2ppyme Estonia should build a 1km tall wall on their borders with Russia and on the whole length of it write a huge "FUCK YOU RUSSIA".

Labelling opposition as Russian agents is nothing but a way to attack them without solving any of the issues they ride on.
Scandinavian languages are cool because they are so strange and interesting.

Chechnya might be part of Russia, but I wouldn't count them as a neighboring country.
Also, I must admin that the searching movies in yandex is some next level
So according to your views, we can also join the US and have one EU + US?
It was aired on Sunday mornings, if I'm not mistaken.
I guess not so much Russian as a non-communist names.
3) The strong language used by some US politicians and journalists against Putin (calling him a killer, dictador, war criminal...) is at odds with the Europan Union approach too.
If your country resists a measure not in your best interests but is outvoted and forced to comply, is that not authoritarianism?
Sometimes it looks cool, sometimes idiotic
I don't remember exactly, but I think it was $30k in the 90s - a fortune.
We are also asking right to return to Circassia, and right to become citizens and maybe the things other repatriates are getting from Russian Federation for the sake of equality.
A better one would be Alsace region in France returning to Germany.
Germans hate Turks, Poles, Russians.
Or it means somebody else did it.
One of them used to visit a summer camp just outside my village
All because they caught a glimpse of some 16 year old guy's soapy ass in their high school's showers and had mixed feelings about it.
All the red countries have pro-russian populist leaders and/or governments.
Filthy gabbers :)

I'm not going to get into that, but her boss is Greek and they clearly have issues with Macedonians ever though it is an Orthodox country.
I have an extremely small, almost negligible amount (2%)
It does explain why Sweden,Finland,Kosovo,Bosnia,Ukraine or Russia are so ready to fight,they all have credible threats to national sovreignty.

But it’s all very theoretical
in case of Russia, probably even more because they have no alternatives (while Europe has, even if not for 100% of its demand),
Он воспользовался Иваном - he used Ivan

Trump builds walls, Putin wants to make Russia bigger, Poland is digging in.
Vote in predetermined elections
Sanctions can always be increased, if Russia continues to do what they're doing.
Neither demand is in any way rational.
but their armed forces along the border with Russia there would be no issue, the reason they don't is because it is ludicrous to think that Russia would start a war with the largest military allience on earth.
Russia is a different ball game altogether.
Even you guys do it better than us.
To repeat myself, even if you leave historical indicators aside, the theory you are presenting has been proven over and over wrong, not only right now with Russia, but many times in the past as well.
So no Estonian, no citizenship.
Every single movie with Russian protagonist from Hollywood
Agriculture subsidies...we receive very little of the EU.
He forgot to put pn his very special helmet and look what happened.
Most of this money is related to proceeds of crime, tax evasion and capital flight.
too much in the US sphere of influence.
So now they're putting Russia in the same boat as ISIS?

Breaking news: Putin made a statement, that Russia will be annexed by Mongolia, for economic reasons, certainly not to avoid joining EU lol
Because factoring out NATO only 2 EU countries maintain really world class militaries.
I would love to see Russia do this.
Putin talks about western meddling in Russia: I know all about your instructions and funding of NGOs

Its bullshit how the whole country has to suffer.
Though it definitely was Russian

Why is it misconception
I must admit that one makes me sad.
Notice you only see people constantly abhor the USA for "installing dictators and invading nations" but there is never a mention of the Soviet Union doing so.
He says "Do not forget Aleppo, do not forget Syria.
The reason for NATO wasn't to protect Europe from an overbearing Russia.

For an union the EU is pretty diverse.
It was pretty much "territorial acquisition to shift the border away from vulnerable SPb" and "a massive failure thanks to the gutted officer corps that had no idea what they were doing".
To be fair, I'm pretty confident that the UK, France and Germany alone could defend Europe from pretty much anyone ...
