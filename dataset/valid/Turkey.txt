Sure, how can you know someone's political alignment from a contemporary political discussion right
PKK also has the operational capacity for that.
Erdogan = Ataturk + Abdul Hamid II
There's always someone else to blame
It’s capital is Ankara
The AKP has liberal rhetoric ?

There are english texts in Turkish Wikipedia sometimes though
They had people who loved them, family, a girlfriend, fiancé. Maybe they had goals to accomplish in life
Its similar situation when you try to distinguish which Sunni organization in Syria is "opposer" and which one is "terrorist".
