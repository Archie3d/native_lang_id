Bares für Rares is a good show
It's basically guaranteed that he'll be there until at least 2022: He tailored the election system in 2011 to his liking, meaning that he made sure that his united populist party will always end up winning against a fractured left, the left is too busy infighting to realize this, and there are suspicions that fidesz is actually funding one of the left parties which doesn't enter into any opposition alliances in order to keep it this way.

It's easy to pretend you are pro-trade with Russia, and thus the heavily hypothetical economic benefits that would arise from it (srsly, Slovakia's export to Russia was 3.6%, while imports from Russia were over double that (7.6% in 2014), which really benefitted Russia way more than it benefitted Slovakia.

We've had a debate about this when we had our ban in place and IMO it's ridiculous to expect that 50-60% of the population (roughly this many people in Hungary said they do shop on some Sundays in representative polls) should adjust their habits so 1% (total number of retail employees affected by Sunday opening, at any one Sunday about 1/4 of those work) would have it easier.
It's pretty skewed, as even in 2018, Fidesz only got 49% of the votes on the general list but they still have majority in the Parliament, mostly because the opposition couldn't agree on who to run as a representative in many places
