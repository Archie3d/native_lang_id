But in our case, probably the fact that we thought Hitler would respect our neutrality
Ok this is pretty weird but isn't it famous because it grows so quickly it's sinking into the ground ?

The worst one however is probably the Marcinelle disaster, which happened in a coal mine called "Bois du Cazier" in Marcinelle, now part of UNESCO World Heritage
It absolutely means nothing and is not related to our word for bag at all
The French are never happy about their president
Weird how belgium is so low swhen we have 3 official languages in Belgium and most younger people can speak english if not broken english

There's a flemish skit where someone from west-flanders (region famous in belgium for it's incomprehensible accent, similar to bavaria to germany, friesland to the netherlands and the USA to the UK) complains about being undertitled and/or dubbed
Especially with how e.g. Finnish wasn't even a recognised language, or how some notable kings of Swedish in the late 18th and early 19th century had absolutist and/or ultraconservative tendencies (and that's an understatement)
The [Court of Justice in Antwerp] is also one of the more modern constructions, but it's straight up r/evilbuildings material

I still believe a country is it strongest on their own not to dance for others
You should really add Congo to  the post-1830 list instead of Luxembourg
