In 1940 when Estonian Soviet socialist republic "became a member" of the USSR, they did some border adjustments where the town of Petseri in the southern Estonia was given to Pskov oblast and the eastern part of Narva, known as Jaanilinn or Ivangorod under the jurisdiction of Leningrad oblast

There's also Narva on the Northeastern Russian border where u can't get stuff done in Estonian because everyone speaks Russian
Yes we do, albeit a smaller one focused towards locals this year
I see it that way too, and that is why I was wondering about how it can be so triggering to Russians to see one picture of an US squad in Narva with American flag that they have to cover it in their mainstream news or how supposedly demeaning it must be to Russians (that was based on the comments in the other thread).
