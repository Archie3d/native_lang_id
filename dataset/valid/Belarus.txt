Or is there some major rivalry between Salzburg and the rest of Austria that I'm not aware of
>This map is outdated somewhat
In Belarus it's technically 90 as well, yet all highways have limit increased to 120
And they do it all with smiles on their faces
120 for Belarus on the highways, 90 for the other roads outside cities, and 90/100 for MKAD beltway in Minsk
Just in few years russian people became ok with killing and invading their "brothers" ukrainians just because they were told on TV and in newspapers that they're fascists
A war with Turkey will ruin Russians' vacation
Not at all
As no one in their right minds would fight to death for the dictator, as everyone knows that he has no real support
by says over 400K.
I don't really know, because it's hard to find statistics from reliable sources, so I will give an answer based on my observations
Maybe some, we have all kind of weird people
You better not
**Shit tonne** of stuff in English doesn't exist in any Slavic language, most prominently the "Θ/th" sound
In the cities it is Russian only, though almost everyone is able to speak Belarusian
000 tanks
Russian propaganda exists in a bubble, but not Russia itself
\- If you forgot to close the doors: "Were you born in a lift
Everyone, literally everyone is very against it
May be that was the point
That can go to "the stupidest things someone said about your country" topic
Livingroom, you say
The radiation release was vast, but it's also spread over a very large area, inhabited by millions of people to this day
Let these stupid people be
In Belarusian it's called "čyhunka", which means something like "cast iron thing"
The mood in the country is very bad at the moment, we are defeated
But this fucking lunatic will reign until his death and will be buried with blue fingers holding his throne
They haven't poisoned nobody yet
Sadly, internet + opinion = downvotes
It looks unexpectedly interesting
They were Lithuanians slaves, Polish slaves, Russian slave and now they are fascists slaves
If you can speak and read Belarusian, you can pretty much understand like 75-80% of what a Ukrainian says or writes
of peaceful people or what
That's not what people want or not want, it's how the politics works in places where there is not political live
Actually any spray or deodorant can be called like that
I always found it hilarious that various German dialects are not just hard to understand to speakers of the other one - they're literally unintelligible
For the rest it was liberation
You're damn right
How delusional
Pskov
If yes, I'm ok with this
If I do it in my neighborhood, I have a bigger chance to be beaten by babushka, who is his supporter, than to attract policemen's attention
Well, if people give money for this, why not
Some people died
Edit: it's pronounced mir btw
World of Tanks is the only one on the tip of my tongue that was made by Belarusians
Who else
Moved to America in late 2003 - early 2004 from my homeland of Belarus
I think the last part was a joke
Honorable non-European mentions to Kyoto, Boston, and Pyongyang, those are also very nice cities to visit
Nice
It's not that Lukashenko doesn't like Belarusian - it's that he doesn't know it ;)
And enough as they have OMON and police on their side
Truth to be told, there were no re-election slogans
I'm speaking about it's documented way to Old Russian, not Bulgarian
This community really is toxic
And this will be only beginning, here our internet is blocked
What
There wont be a civil war at this moment, I hope
I wouldn't understand why anyone would, but if you do, I'd say learn to pronounce г, ў, шч, and especially Ы.
Germans too aren't big on making territorial claims nowadays
Some would say the Principality of Polatsk or even the current Republic of Belarus
They're so pretty this time of year
I'd say either the BNR or _maybe_ the GDL would be the first major examples of a mostly belarusian state
In jail people were tortured
Ah, okay, I stand corrected
Oh, and don't forget the high crime
" = "put Lukashenko in vehicle used for transporting political prisoners" was real popular in Minsk today
are now enemies, american puppets, fascists etc
We have quite a lot:
Totalitarian in case of Poland
And the visa is pretty expensive
As much as I dislike Lukashenko, I can appreciate that he's trying to make the Belarusian populous Belarusian and not "BelaRussian"
And you'll get quite usual tanned skin
The speed with which Italians speak English is terrifying
[Not necessarily
As you said, it does not work like this
Who else
World of Tanks is the only one on the tip of my tongue that was made by Belarusians
I sometimes do to my Latveedzan friends
Oh, I was so annoyed by "no cards" thing in Italy
We are literally the only real dictatorship in Europe
Seeing violent crackdowns like these literally everywhere in the world makes me think true democracy doesn't exist
See, the thing about lack of teaching "compulsory Russian" to Russophones is that it won't lead to them switching to whatever the language they're taught instead - it will merely make them functionally illiterate
I almost sure there's a strong connection between political views and ability to travel
Kind of killed any possibility of either treating the Warsaw Pact as an alliance of sovereign state and the Soviet high ground with regards to being the only Great Power willing to (and prevented from) help Czechoslovakia during Munich Conspiracy
Use it with respect
Salary is not everything
The destruction is massive, and the "abandoned", frozen in time look is mostly gone, replaced by more of a Capital Wasteland look from Fallout 4
Not at all
And let's not forget about [Reverse Lend-Lease] to U.S.A. from the allies
Novgorod, Pskov and Tver wanted to join GDL and RP and were destroyed
Set up Belarusian schools in small cities
З днём незалежнасцi, Лiтва! / Happy independence day, Lithuania
I didn't expect that it's so calm and reasonable
A ver donde esta España...
Yep, you guys are in the same situation, have your own beautiful language but speak the language of the country that you historically hated  and everyone feels that it's wrong but it's too late to change things
EDIT: A linguist claiming that Georgia (Migrelian, Svan) and Estonia (Russian, obviously) aren't linguistically diverse
And some other random people in the list who are even worse in a way
Finland already lost and switched over by that time, and your deal with USSR (including the border changes - mostly Pestamo) was pretty much set in stone
What about Belarus
It is the first time in my 30+ years existence when I don't want to live in my country, but there's no place to go as noone needs another immigrant from fucking Belarus
So, how much discomfort are the Dutch people willing to tolerate for the sake of having a less negative impact on the environment
We haven't another option in my city
Africa,
Belarus is not really bilingual, everyone speaks Russian or a crazy mixture of both, but Belarusian is taught in schools, represented in media, signs on the streets and transportation announcements are strictly in Belarusian
I think Polotsk because its oldest city in my country and i he has more interesting history
You sentence contains a contradiction
> Not all of them are "caucasian"
On North Pole
Not really
If I do it in my neighborhood, I have a bigger chance to be beaten by babushka, who is his supporter, than to attract policemen's attention
Maybe there's hope for my land too
Delightful, huh
Those days "it was known as the "land of the Rus"/  Slavic: Rus' ,  *Rus'skaya zemlya* / Latin: Rus(s)ia  (with local German spelling variants *Ruscia* and *Ruzzia*) "
Basically, they arrest whoever comes to their mind/happens to be near them
I'm the same, our country has a lot to offer if you forget about his reign as we do here (which is very easy as people are friendly, beer and food is good etc)
I love how they called my country bc true
Based on your comment you would see US
Another great day even though it didn't feel like a fest anymore
The standard punishment from courts is 15 days / a fine
But if we're specifically talking about OMON (I take it these *are* the guys on the left) than they are almost all insane
In Belarusian it's [s'neh]
Except that there wasn't even a mumble about any sort of things like that in Czechoslovakia, and it's not like there was no way to let the events play out before deciding to crush it
Russia, stop staring at us
We have a lot of russian tourists in Belarus
Our protest is peaceful
He was from 1993-4 IIRC
Yes
Yeah, the puppet state in the sense that Russia supports this regime economically and politically
And this will be only beginning, here our internet is blocked
It literally means cattle and used as beast/animal for a person
Ayy lmao does this mean we still have the dankest memes
Just how Latin ain't English but just because you can read Latin/Cyrillic doesn't mean you can understand all languages using said alphabet
I wonder how old were the people that took part in this poll
Like between Russian and Ukrainian, Polish and Czech
To sum up: not so many people visit Belarus if you don't count Russians (for them it's top 1 country to visit on holiday)
There needs to be at least *some* government support for the creation of media in Belarusian
Truth to be told, there were no re-election slogans
As no one in their right minds would fight to death for the dictator, as everyone knows that he has no real support
01) christmas
Also Belarusian became a hipster and opposition language: some people speak only Belarusian, they are mostly artists, actors etc or opposition of course, they are viewed as weirdos by general Luka's fan base :-/
Baltic countries, Georgia, now Ukraine and sometimes others too if needed
We haven't another option in my city
Everyone is moving west, you just wait untill you get your own migrants from Russia
And that's where this word starts being widely accepted by people living there
Hungary made sense, both sides did things like that (see South Vietnam) but behaviour towards Czechoslovakia in relatively peaceful Brezhnev time was outright disgusting
There is no law in this country anymore
Yep, during WW1
It's a game to them, they like to play games with prisoners (those usually involve beatings, bone-breaking or even rape)
*Cosmonauts
By that logic, our anti-German sentiment should be through the roof
By democracy index belarus is way lower and overall Belarus is more authoritarian
And we have the 2nd worst passport right before Kosovo
Nice
I'd personally go with Mozart if I were you but feel free to disagree ;)))
It's one of the problems
Yes
No love between Putin and Lukashenko though, they hate each other
All Ukraine went to EuroMaidan in Kyiv
Definitely not the worst in the world, to be honest
* Omsk (pretty new meme in Russia, "no one can escape from Omsk")
Fuck that
B) you can take them with you
Happy cake day, neighbors
And the visa is pretty expensive
Why is it so bad in Italy
" = "put Lukashenko in vehicle used for transporting political prisoners" was real popular in Minsk today
In my country many people still set the table right on the grave
It can be fixed by cell itself and it does it all the time
There is a handful of places in Belarus that don't take cards, even in tiniest towns or villages
Congratulations, Montenegrin slavic brothers, we hope to follow suit
Maybe at some point with some other Lithuanian communist leaders it would have been transferred over to Vilnius control Crimea-style but as it was they were quite steadfast in not wanting it
Larger cities have very few of them too but that's mostly based on "market" forces, since parents rarely enrol their children in them
You think it was Boris Johnson who brexited
Is it Veyshnoria
Nobody else really claims it
The only problem russian drivers park like children leave their toys on a playground
The rebuilt old Town, or commi blocks, or a few glass skyscrapers
In Belarus Pan Tadeusz is known, but it's not a core part of ideology (probably as it's in Polish)
Try  Israel - at least 2 of theirs originally hail from Belarus
Larger cities have very few of them too but that's mostly based on "market" forces, since parents rarely enrol their children in them
Oh, and don't forget the high crime
No real obligations on that agreement, it's more like declaration of intentions
Google "Lukashenko undress and work" to start with
If we talk about possible violent scenarios, sieging govt buildings is too dangerous at this stage, but many people talk about partizan war where they find people from OMON (the special division of police which did all tortures and killings across the country) and beating them up, putting their cars on flames or killing them
I don't know how it is possible to reign knowing everyone hates you excluding some ass lickers
Because I watch money heist at the moment
Not millions , just like a little bit more then million and a half
I don't think foreign dynasties count
Not exactly a massively dangerous issue
We can only regret that Belarussian autoritarism is based on elderly-based populism and has nothing to suggest except of "let it be as it is". But we can clearly see the same tendency in Europe and the USA
I don't really know, because it's hard to find statistics from reliable sources, so I will give an answer based on my observations
The only effective solution that I see is a nationwide strike, but it will not happen yet since a lot of people are not concerned with what's going on
The others I only really hear during the World Cup, so
such a fucking long and boring ride
The score is ??? : 0
Is this stat just for nationality
It is so fucking depressing, he is an absolute lunatic giving himself over 80% when he actually got 20 maximum
How did they shit and piss in space
OK, I think this lady was arrested because she held a camera and was shooting the scene how Konstatin Prydybailo, a Russian-related, pro-Lukashenko journalist takes an interview from the famous protester old lady
Google "Lukashenko undress and work" to start with
Eastern Slavic languages have an even weirder form of this
