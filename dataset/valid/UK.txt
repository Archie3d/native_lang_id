Present problems in the south have deep historical roots which were briefly shoved under the carpet from the 80s up until the 08 crisis hit, all thanks to cheap credit which fueled growth booms in all of those countries, growth that didn't result in the creation of wealth-producing industries in most cases due to the nature of the modern day global market, simply put they had zero chance of being able to compete with the already established industrial giants, and industry could (still can) be always outsourced to places with cheaper labour

Like how Norwegian and English are both Germanic but come from different Germanic sub-families
Similar in Scotland, where we have our own local standard and no one learns 'British English' in schools, they just pick up Standard Scottish English to a greater or lesser degree.
Scotland isn't going independent any time soon.

But to rep my own city [Liverpool World Museum] is a pretty solid choice, as well as the Slavery/Maritime/Museum of Liverpool (they’re on the same site) if you ever want to visit the city and know more about Liverpool’s history in particular- the Slavery/Maritime museums aren’t just about that but do focus decently on Liverpool’s role in slavery/maritime history

The ability to protect ourselves at sea should be our primary defence aim, I don't personally see a need for a massive standing army, but at the very least, the ability to protect 95% of our overseas economic activity (of which it arrives by sea) is a vital national interest.

My regret for my country is getting involved in the way we did too, I believe if Chamberlain carried on peace talks with Germany we would’ve achieved peace and an agreement without war
No he wrote that people have reasons for voting the way they do and that a large proportion of people can't understand why they vote that way.

The face of *anyone* reacting to a minority of people who can say it is priceless
They just trot along and seem to imply that they're waiting for Scotland to do all the work before they would be confident enough to think that they actually do have a right to self determination.

There's probably similar chains in the UK but none are springing to mind right now.
But I'm not sure I'd call it necessarily 'American' - more 'Victorian'. The idea of social welfare as a begrudgingly charitable way of helping the poor to help themselves isn't a new thing

This was gonna be my answer but with Czech and Czechs
Drawing a distinction between Scotland and the Empire in a feeble attempt to distance themselves from their own country's and ancestors' imperial pasts, denying Scotland was up to her neck in colonisations and plantings, pretending the Act of Union 1707 was an act of English coercion rather than bailing out the failed Scottish state and joining two countries already in personal union under a Scottish monarch, downplaying Scotland's role in Ireland, and acting as if William Wallace's rebellion was anything other than illegal and without merit...

Turkey on the other hand is currently refusing PKK offers to return to the negotiations, and has never demonstrated sincere commitment to a negotiated solution, which is a large part of the reason why Kurds still resort to war even after how little good it's done them - Ankara closed every other door.

If you see a lot UK flags you're in a loyalist/protestant area, probably controled by someone like the UVF or UDA (you'll often see their own flags being flown too) and if you see a lot of Irish tricolours you're in a republican/catholic area (republican pararmilitaries don't have their own flags usually, they tend to be more low key than the loyalists)

Everybody else who replied is *in* Europe.
It's also campaigning for things that are popular but unsustainable (like seizing central bank reserves to spend on subsidies to take an extreme example), that won't achieve what they claim (leaving the EU to increase wages or subsidizing house purchases to make housing more affordable), or that work against the interests of the people they claim to help.
