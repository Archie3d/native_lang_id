Learning German would be useful.
Russia really has no stance on this, in fact I think they'd even like us to join because then they'd have an ally on the inside

I can make nonsensical statements too.
They accused Julian Assange of pedophilia, they claim russia "hacked the election" even though the farthest claim is that they hacked the DNC and gave the information to Wikileaks, however we have evidence that John Podesta's email account wasn't hacked, he fell into a basic phishing scam.

What's pretty big tradition with us Serbs is "Slava" it's basically celebrating your family's patron saint this is inherited paternally mostly, this tradition started as ancient Slavic pagan tradition where Slavs celebrated their gods but when Serbs baptized in 9th century our old gods were replaced with christian saints and that is basically how an ancient Slavic pagan tradition that was probably a core tradition to pagan Serbs adapted to Christianity and still persists to this day

So who is going to block Serbia over border with Kosovo then?
They have full mouths all the time about human rights and democracy and morality.
Oh please, Serbia is a small country, it can't destroy the EU.
Also people saying Princip was a Serb nationalist, remember, he was a Yugoslav nationalist, those were very different (and still are) things.
Overall it would be better to have a country that's functioning, without gazzilion of management related and other problems caused by corrupted and incompetent people (Most of Ex-Yu countries), which would look on joining EU as some kind of benefit to extends its business/power projection.
Mostly around the border with Bosnia
Montenegrin politicians and people were supportive

The revenge was carried out against someone other than the perpetrator
in Serbia the name Serbistan is used by the locals in self-mocking manner (like when you imply/comment that Serbia is a banana country).

They certainly didn't packed up and fled because they liked to begin their lifes all over again, especially if they had jobs, properties and friends in Sarajevo, did they?

It is sad that people here are so primitive, but it is a fact.

something interesting i've noticed is bulgarians and macedonians are able to understand serbian FAR better than we're able to understand their languages.
I am surprised that Serbia is comparably low though.

He left the country and is hiding because of multiple investigations against him.
I am personally thankful people like you exist, even though you(personally) usually have a very disturbed anti Serbia agenda, people like you are useful to expose the bad things about Serbia without remorse or trying to keep good/bad balance in a comment.

Both pretty much come from the school of anti-progressives
Our surnames came from the name or profession of one person from distant past
>If we wanted to take anything back from Serbia
Kosovo wasn't majority Serb for a lot longer than 8 years, so Serbia basically only lost control of an area they ruled over.
Here and there
In north-western Bulgaria we use some Serbian words, like "ja" for "I" instead of "az", and even some Macedonian ones like "sakam" for "want" instead of "iskam".
Only one
They will lie about this, then they will find traitors or some other reason - it will never come to accepting responsibility for anything

Remember that there are some weird passport issues with Serbia/Kosovo.
You're very much right, but sometimes it's quicker to refer to something in your native language to the other person you're playing with
Not when there are neighbouring countries like Russia and Ukraine, North and South Korea, Russia and Georgia, Serbia and Kosovo, and so on, and so on.
During war with Bulgaria in 1885 we let Red cross pass through our country to help wounded Bulgarians .

I'm not so sure about that anymore
How come Czechs are so irreligious?
Some symbol, like a crown or a banner or an animal perhaps?
However, it's the only (European) language that is 100% phonetic alongside Macedonian

Wow so many rules all over the place, it is hard to keep track of it
The loss of 1.5 million people are irrelevant to the French society, culture and economy, in comparison to losses in Serbia.
The debate has been rendered pointless on this point I guess.
But bet your ass it sounds more impressive to almost anyone when you say you're a surgeon than plumber.
No one questions Serbs right to self determination.

The PM is not a good person in my opinion, but I don't think he's in real danger of assassination, these are probably publicity stunts for us to be alarmed for the safety of our Leader, or they're pulling wool over our eyes.
Happy birthday basketball bros!
They are small minority tho, what is staggering is that there would be any nazi supporters in Serbia, which had it lost WW2 would be in deep trouble, because as you see their territory was partitioned/taken by everyone around during the war with only small part still being Serbia.
Honestly some people also get life in prison in Serbia too, for example some guy kidnapped,raped and killed little girl 2 years back and is in prison for life(until someone kills him in there)

As for the bosnian redditor who said another country controlling other countries parties, I welcome him to see what happens to the Serbian party in Kosovo, they openly hold meetings with Belgrade government in Government building and have their allegiance with Belgrade.

Kosovo's future status would take into consideration the Rambouillet Agreement which Serbia refused to sign in 1998, and which calls for the "will of the people of Kosovo" to be one of the guiding principles in defining Kosovo's status, another being the respective compliance of the disputing parties to the Agreement.

It would be impossible for them to govern, the expenses and financial burden on the rest of the country would be immense, crime would go up through the roof, terrorism would be an issue for decades to come, and it *still* wouldn't be easy for people who were forced to leave to return.
If the serbian republic in Bosnia wants to Join Serbia, and Serbia wants that too, it should happen regardless of the situation in Kosovo
I cannot decide if it's worth paying extra 75$ to travel from my country to Kuala Lumpur with turkish airlines which has only 1 stop in Istanbul (2h10m wait) or should i save the money and pick the cheapest option which consist of 2 stops, first in Belgrade (1h30m) and second in Abu Dhabi (2h5m) with Air Serbia+Etihad Airways.
"Crypto-Christianity in the Balkan Area under the Ottomans". *Slavic Review*. **26** (2): 227–246 , pp
I would say excuse me or Sorry, but in the UK it seemed much more prevalent.
Serbia lost 60% of its male population and about 30% overall, it was quite devastating
"In 1878, following a series of Christian uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, the Russo-Turkish War, and the Berlin Congress, Serbia gained complete independence, as well as new territories in the Toplica and Kosanica regions adjacent to Kosovo
But no European country came close to the devastation suffered by Serbia.
Slovene and Croat language is almost identical just like German & Austrian German and Bosnian & Serbian & Croatian, right
His Serbian is good, but he has just a bit of trouble pronouncing the Č (ch) sound :).
Very quickly there would be unrest and people would try to storm the border.

What are you going to say next
This sounds very superficial
Of course, if someone asked me what my native language was, I'd say Serbian, but if I were asked if I spoke Serbocroatian I'd say yes.
Albanians who did move to Kosovo in the following 200 years had no such intentions, and saying we did the "same thing" 200 years later is laughable already

The Kurds are a nation of 40 million people(almost all of the Balkans combined) and demand autonomy or independence, their cause is legitimate if Turkey is legitimate.

Cmon, this is basic stuff people, it’s not that hard to start a war
Maybe if the bus driver was nice but usually they're douches and you don't even talk to them
I don't think it has anything to do with EU
So let me get this straight, Kosovo declares independence from Serbia unilaterally through what Serbia considers to be an illegal act.
I mean, the point of no return was an ultimatum made with the only purpose of declaring the war to Serbia; ultimatum backed up by the káiser and the chancellor of Germany prior it was even done (Count of Hoyos visit to Germany and all that).

Okay, I could tell Kajkavian from Shtokavian.
They did not manage it so good.Even before 1821,there were various little revolts going on around Greece.People were obvious not happy.If Greece,let's say,was under Austrian occupation(I said that before but anyway),I will go as far to say that Greeks would have completely adapted into Austrian culture and a revolution would really happen years later of the 1821 revolution.The Ottomans just wanted taxes and wars,while the people inside their empire were unhappy and planning revolts.Alexander for instance,managed to Hellenize most of the Middle East,and it's a historical fact that Alexander's conquered lands were seeing themselves as Greek,I doubt Serbians ever considered themselves as Turkish,even though they were under Ottoman occupation for centuries.
I have family in Serbia and Croatia, I was born in Slovenia and I'm named after my grandfather and he was named after the most famous ruler of Serbia, Dušan Silni.

Basically, from what I remember, it was: State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs wasn't internationally recognized, so [...] it joined with the Kingdom of Serbia, which has before that already [joined/merged/annexed/unclear] with Kingdom of Montenegro, to form Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
yea my bad, he's being investigated
And Serbia feels very different than Bosnia.
• Serbia won WW1 I don't think it was expected for them to give up power to those that fought on the opposite side like Croatians
If I recall correctly they were an indepedant kingdom before WW1 and somehow got annexed by the Serbia during on shortly after the end of the war, which is surprising seeing how they both fought against Austro-Hungary.
I know that it's name in Serbian is Cherna Gora, which, like the name Montenegro translates into english as "Black Mountain".

Also these people wanted to make a independence referendum around 1991/1992 but weren't let by Kiev, why shouldn't they have the right to do it, if for example parts of Serbia try to separate from it?

Everyone can become an ally if they have their own interests, so Germany and every other strong European country or even America is not letting Kosovo get in the hands of Serbia, because Kosovo has a lot of benefits(Trepca for example) and strong European countries would lend a hand in the war for their own interests, because this is how it has always been, nations make allies according to their interests.

All i know about it is that it was part of Yugoslavia but they are on good terms with Serbia.
Because, Serbia for instance, got over the WW2 pretty quick even though hundreds of thousands of Serbs were executed at the hands of Croatian Ultra Nationalist.
And if does escalate, at least i have the comfort of knowing Serbia isnt bound by any deal to aid anyone

No matter how big of scumbag he was, The Hague tribunal posthumously acquitted him for war crimes in Bosnia.
I was thinking more on a subtitle differences in a meaning of words and phrases, their places and roles in the sentences
Most agree that the EU isn't worth losing Kosovo (or at least losing rights to Kosovo), it's too important to us culturally, historically and not to mention our people and cultural sights are in danger there so it's basically betrayal at that point
It's like saying beans are a type of soup, at least it feels that way to me :)
Yeah, we say "unutrašnjost", which literally translates into "the insides", for pretty much everything that is not Belgrade (plus two larger cities)
if you're talking about u/Gawur s list, he linked crimes after 1737 to Kosovo War, and whats even more shocking, is that Albanians continiued to massacre Serbs after the fucking war.

I refuse to believe that the difference between Ireland and Croatia is so small.
If Germany didn't just offer tons money to everyone who has their asylum application rejected, then you would not be having this problem in the first place and you would not even have to think about restricting borders with countries like Serbia.

No amount of repairs will save the fighter component of the Serbian airforce, they need new airframes.
You sound like a really nice person
The bad relation to Croatia is because of the Croatian Independence War, the bad relation to B&H is because of the Bosnian War, the bad relation to Kosovo (if you can even call it relation if they don't recognize Kosovo) is because of the Kosovo War, the bad relation with Albania has also a lot to do with Kosovo (I'm mentioning Albania as a neighbour even though it doesn't really border Serbia anymore since the war).

Yeah just like in the good ol' 40s.
On one side you have China whith which Serbia does have friendly connection since 70's if not even before that, on the other you have countries that bombarded them, implemented extremely harsh sanctions, and before that killed 20% of people in WW2 and 25% of people in WW1

Face it Russia, most ex USSR countries dont want to join the Russia club.

Kusturica is indeed best director we have, but people need to know Balkan's mentality to understand them
Russia wants clearly to unstabilize the area.
Head, shoulders, stomach, knees
Understandable
I prefer them as South Serbia and South-south Serbia.
Or the moment the world will be tired of your nonsense, and there will come a time where you will be the only ones believing that Kosovo is Serbia .
If you work for 300/400E, which a lot of people in Serbia do, it's very hard to live alone in an apartment where the rent would be minimum 200E.
Don't forget Ukraine lost it's legit government during that time.
In Croatia and Bosnia they say grah for beans but we say pasulj or kruh for bread and here it's hleb
Serbs in today Serbia lived under Byzantium, but Byzantium influence was quite strong and we were unable to form stabile state in those areas.

It’s cultural thing, really
Of course, during this period ethnic Albanians begin to form a majority in the region and they begin to hear irredentist calls from Albania to form a Greater Albania.
I'm orthodox christian and I know that majority of people in Serbia don't fast when it's supposed to, or don't go to church as many times as they should

In middle school history class the teacher told us that if Serbia suffered a major loss in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo the European continent would have been overrun by the Ottomans at a much earlier age & with a greater force, probably ensuring permanent dominance of the Turks even today
Minorities have never been a problem in the Albanian communities, but if they want Serbian culture and flags they should move to Serbia..
The RDC is based in Sarajevo and an inpendent institution, which obviously makes it prone to be less objective.
3 presidents they each take turns who's gonna be president of the presidency, 3 constituent peoples of which 2 want to separate and everyone wants something different for the country so serious decision making is impossible
Massacres =/= genocide, as you can see, Albanians massacred Serbs *AFTER* the war and committed the largest single massacre that is Organ Theft, so the only one here denying crimes is you.

Don't even care if they sound pretentious or wildly outdated
You asked for an article which identifies the threat.
Maybe you should ask how other people live in Hungarian dominated areas, Serbs can't use their language as Hungarians usually ignore when somebody askes them in some other language (although Hungarians know it, of course), I know for that as I heard a lot of examples, from shops, train stations etc.

"Lay person" ahahahahah, this is ridiculous.
Italia is missing to me, feeling sad because at the moment travelling is not good idea
it's quite interesting - hungarian and finnish are even farther relatives than russian and english (8000 years vs 4000) but the former two retain more grammatical similarities with each other, than the latter two.
What's happening in EU is not much different from USA I think.
Not to say those aren't important, but you don't die if you go a week without them.
