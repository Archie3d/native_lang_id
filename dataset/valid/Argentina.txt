Not to the point of choosing something that makes you miserable, but an unbalanced job, or one that pays too little, or perhaps that makes you travel a lot if you have family, or one that has too few spots to get into
This, obviously, said by populists who try to find an outside enemy and avoid criticism
Having a Polish Pope probably helped

In ushuaia in these last years the average temperature increased a lot because the hole in the ozone layer but aprox 18 c max and -20 on winter, on hot days it can go to 20 or 21 but its rare, also a lot of water that used to transform in snow is now rain and that clears the snow and raises the temperature

The Polish embassy in Argentina is actually closed to the public most days because they don't want to deal with all the citizenship requests, they're not equiped for such a large volume of bureaucratic work

I mean, they speak a bit fast but not TOO fast
We have our own version, we call it fugaza (which sounds almost the same but with a final A)
Lol do u know what that means
I think in some culture people either feel embarrassed about it or believe their kids would do exactly as told just because they said so, which is obviously not the case, no matter how religious the family is, if kids want to have sex they will do it, if not at home, at an hotel, or a car, or a friend home,... or the school, or while camping--- you get the idea
