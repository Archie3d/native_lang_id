"Agnostic atheism" is in fact the default position most atheists have, as in, they do not believe or want to (are irreligious) but also abstain from making claims on whether god exists; this is something only "militant atheists" sometimes do, but it's rarely dressed in absolute sounding language

Yeah Alexander the Great did that too.But guess what.Centuries after that,the Celtic tribes were fully Romanized and were proud Roman citizens.The same with Persians,many of them adapted impressively into Greek culture.There's a difference with the Ottomans.They failed on many sectors except conquest.No one in Balkans and Greece turned muslim and adapted into Turkish culture(except Bosnia I guess).And those who did were forced to.That's why the Greeks revolted.They were poor,desperate and living under some violent oppressors who never gave a shit about them.

As for religion and rules Greece is a secular society so rules apply only if you feel like it
Italy poses a huge threat to the euro and union
The people who complain about the "military to Russia's doorstep" are the vile Hitleric scum who want the Baltics and the rest of Eastern Europe to be utterly defenseless when Russia decides to invade and recapture them.

People in Greece are more well off than our neighbours, but poor compared to the rest of the EU
So you're saying they would do what, suspend the elections and take over the factories in order to bring about communism when they're in power
Btw the weird thing about anti-EU sentiment is that think that eu turns Europe into a Nazi empire and from the other hand they consider that it has a extreme left wing agenda
No that's why I said" I think", I know that the suffix -Ίδα/-ιδας means son/daughter of (hence leonidas means Lion's son) so I figured that's what it meant but I'm in no way sure of it, I tried to google it but nothing helpful came up

However, the gossip stays still, an unbending rock in my culture's traditions and so, while it is not so common to overhear people who are/have been pregnant or even people who are not pregnant talking about it with painstaking detail, it can be a thing, mostly advice to teenage girls and soon-to-be parents, or even a quick elaboration on it while discussing a related subject
