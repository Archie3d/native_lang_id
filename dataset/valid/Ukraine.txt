Anyways good that Ukrainians fought back in Donbass else half of Ukraine would also be included in this annoying video
I play mostly The New Order for hoi iv
Hope it works
Crimea has been russian for longer than Ukraine has been a country.
As for countries beating the shit out of each other in the world wars, I don't find them getting along unnatural
It's often romantic but not necessarily
OSCE blamed russia for the escalation so stop trolling.
Revolutions happen when people have nowhere to live and/or nothing to eat, or are in immediate danger of that.
Even if Ukraine would let go of Crimea and Donbas, what's the guarantee that there won't be new waves of Russian tourists wandering further West to prevent Ukraine from joining EU/NATO?
И божья благодать пала на Грузию
I thought rulers of Commonwealth were actually Lithuanians residing on Polish throne as the country had the higher status before merging
This is what case-fire pretty much is, that's the best one can hope for without diplomatic talks.
here's something to better understand who he was
You know like most countries do.
Common criminals sometimes get away because we don't know who did it.
Which is kind of sad given that you for some reason decided to attend one, instead of going to a vocational college where you just "learn and go home".
Let's do it in the steppes of Ukraine, as is tradition.
* Period of political struggle for Independence during perestroika and early 1990's
Notice how almost every single Russian neighbour doesn't recognise dual citizenship?
And those Soviet people who stayed here are old now and they are not going to change their place of residence.
Lenin, Stalin,Mao and many others called themselves communists(of course what they did differs from "a textbook definition",but the same goes for many things in our history (medieval feodals sure protected their subjects and always ruled with justice))
No, but denying that there are hardliner nazis in Ukraine is as foolish as exaggerating their numbers.
Kept cackling like a hen for water;
Why don't you travel to the Ukraine to find out how much Poland profits from the single market.
There are big festivals and Yacht Week
Also we have that stereotypical image of a Serb here that hates each and every of his neighbours (especially Croats), is super nationalistic and thinks of Russia as a great friend of their nation
I would see Lithuania as the most vulnerable, if the Russian government felt its access to Kaliningrad were threatened.
They don't (at least weren't in 2014).
В, у = in
There are roughly 20 million native speakers in those 2 countries.
That's what the sanctions are for.
It's not about what we do, it's about what you believe.
I love how the stupid non-binding Ukraine referendum disaster and Brexit made most bigger parties that were in favour of a binding referendum reconsider their stances.
And now Ukraine becomes the enemy of the world as the first country that decided to use it against someone else since WW2.
Lithuanian charity concert in gathers 140,000 Euro to support Ukraine
Also, if you hate it so much, then why are you so concerned about Crimea.
In Ukraine, the tradition for *"pan/pani"* is more common in the west which is closer to Central European Slavic-speaking countries
I will attend, after the territories of my Fatherland are returned and peace is established"
Our number is low because we didn't do many tests, as soon as we start doing test en masse we will be at least at Poland level (if not worse)
Pros:
Slovakia and Romania have pretty major towns which are majority Hungarian, but there are some in Ukraine and Serbia too.

Just because it doesn't exist it doesn't mean you don't white wash their history, I seen you doing it not long ago.

There were so many people trying to buy something in the first day, that the site is still a little bit laggy

Trusting Russia
However, they're quite different
It's slow and why would I do it
Nope that doesn't explain it, Poland and Ukraine are Slavic too but they also have the "pleasure" of having Russia as a neighbor.
Ukraine urges Dutch to sign EU deal
Count of voters were even numbers, something like 95.730000%.
Whom I should believe: NATO and western politicians who are at least under close journalists surveillance or Kremlin which lied to entire world about "green man" in Crimea and controls 99% of media inside Russia?
I think we all are used to the "Go back to Mongolia/Ukraine/Whatever" arguments.
Гжегож Бжечищикевич is still quite a mouthful :)
Same happens with Russian phrases in Ukrainian, but to a lesser extent, and people have no problem with that
Debt crisis, Ukraine crisis, refugee crisis, Brexit crisis.
Maybe i'm OT, excuse me if I can't help but feel rancor towards Putin as much as towards Poroshenko.
It annexed Crimea and the world did nothing.
You fight fire with fire, time to wake up and realise Russia isn't fighting with fire any more.
>Do you mean pathos (if so I don't know what that means) or is that a typo of potatoes
Oof
I think he meant the Ukraine/Russia situation.

Actually, often they are just called extra counties of Hungary.
it will be better for the whole world.

Also, maybe the EU countries that have a say in the matter could push for the involvement of the UN in a humanitarian mission within the Ukraine.
The newest term is "*тітушко/titushko*" (plural, "*тітушки/titushky*") - thugs hired by different political forces to either pacify or provoke protesters, or pose as them to create a negative social image (within the country and in foreign media)
Nordic states want EU decision on Russia pipeline
But even earlier I saw a lot of crazy and reckless shit, but not on such massive scale and not crazy like that.
Artillery is being used in Ukraine because the conflict is frozen.
Russian Empire annexed some lands from neighboring empires which form Western parts of modern Ukraine though, that much is true.
It's called Kholodets'.
That's the place to change into house slippers
Although, I like "breakfast, dinner, and supper" more than "breakfast, lunch, and dinner".
Because the buzz of Putin's lover Orban is not an argument at all
The current one is just a rehash of the soviet one imho.
Most Ukrainians are probably more familiar with the regions in their immediate surroundings and perceive everything else in more general terms.
That's why middle east is so fucked up.
Finally, answering the main question of whether we feel overwhelmed by the news from Russia, I'd say we don't. We get as much Russian news as everyone; the difference is, we hear them in the language we actually speak, get all the references and minuscule details, and can interpret them in the context of those shared informational years
At that point there were no, to very little ethnic Russians on the peninsula.
"It wasn't us, but all traitors will end up like this
Tanks are scarce and mostly sitting ducks for the artillery anyway.
If I remember correctly, the proper was to write Білоруський in English is "Belarus". As in "Belarus President" or "Belarus potatoes". Or at least that's what I've been taught in the University back in 2010 when I learned Political translation
You think that Ukraine, Africa or whoever needs this.
That you can’t see the same pictures there?.
Decommunisation and all
Of course, Ukraine was one of very few countries which didn't arrest and extradite him.
Mama Russia did not like that very much, now did it.
That was the case for them since mid-XIII, why should they change their mind now?
>With solid help from the allies no less, as they feared the Italian communists more
I agree though that Ukraine needs extensive humanitarian support in order to ensure a proper resettlement within the country.
When it comes to facial expressions, I can't put this feeling into words
Japanese has a beautiful rhythm, so it sounds cool and stylish
Thanks
It's more complex than just asking people about how much corruption they believe we have.
Ukraine has a wrong shade in the map and the rest has no data or what?
They agreed to respect Ukraine's borders and sovereignty.
Poland was granted independence and Lithuania and Ukraine became more autonomous
Of course, 65-70% of the Ukrainians actually do, which piss me of so much, but there are a big amount of people who speak in the language of the country in which they live
Besides, Turkey's a mess that Russia can't afford to get involved in, with Ukraine already a big row for Russia to handle
I'm guessing its conflicts in Syria & Ukraine.
so close to your neighbor's borde
You can't have feelings or emotions in the eternal great game between nations.
Ukraine will be left with no other choice ultimately.
This is just coalition of NGO-s.

Slovenia has mountains
Rest in pieces and don't get too scorched down there.
> Ukraine is still way far in meeting the Copenhagen Criteria
You are safe
Yes, it is what many Europeans don't understand: it is not really about Ukraine - it is about stability in Europe and in the world (look at Syria).
Where's Ukraine was my first thought
The truth has been settled in this case.
Also according to this article Dozhd agreed to run ad-free broadcast and the authorities were notified on this, so I doubt that they were shut down because of this "foreign advertising law"
I've heard some associations with Gypsies; maybe it had happened before I started frequenting AskEurope, too, but since I got more aware of the Gypsy stereotype it's been mentioned 2 times by older people (60+)
omg, ikr
So that's pretty progressive, I would say
The red fat cat man was quite weird, but at times the weird of his was even weirder than usual
Thank you, Lithuania, for the consistent support
I suppose it depends on how you look at it.
Well, they're surely weren't Russian.
Its armenian church, not catholic and not orthodox,
So its no wonder Russian influence is falling,
There was an awesome news site called lenta.ru.

These are just a few of the economic powerhouses with serious immigration problems.
What is medieval is the tactics of military land grabs still being exercised by your country.
EU was one of the biggest promoters of free trade agreements since forever
The Ukraine crisis has sort of disappeared in western European mainstream media since it became a stalemate.
I think I've seen another trend.
There is so much poverty in Ukraine and Turkey.
Putin is a very dangerous man, A man who lived through and probably is still salty about the demise of the soviet union.
What does Merkel have to do with what is happening in the Ukraine?
haydamak or haiduk, also a thing in Ukraine
Also Russia may have already forces inside country, not just on peninsula like in Ukraine, also their military cooperation is much closer.
When I use English for specific purposes, for example, arguing about the human rights of seashore gulls on the Internet but ignore the topic completely in real life, the needed vocabulary in Ukrainian or Russian escapes my mind completely

Your arguments read a bit like a schoolground bully asking "Why are you hitting yourself".
But russian oligarchs put propagandist in charge which caused up to 75% of personnel to leave country and found meduza.io .
Or you might have an ally in a similar position as Ukraine with whom you could create a united front, backed by the EU, against an increasingly aggressive Russia (we can dream at least).
Fillon told the newspaper, arguing instead for an economic partnership and the convening of a security conference once Russia respects the Minsk peace accord for eastern Ukraine.
But there are a lot of cities made from deported Ukrainian deep within Russia.
Not Russia's threatening attitude and half century of occupation.
The Golden Horde is a myth that was made by rulers of Rus' to hide the evidences of their acts
That visa free travel doesn't mean people from Ukraine can get work in Chech republic without additional permission.
After all, how cam someone who lived in Ukraine, has Ukranian citizenship, and being in Kiev during events (that's me), propagate something contrary to you opinion?
Trump is in office, his focus will be China and Iran, not Russia.
The other is buying into Russian propaganda, which is saying that it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine.
On one occasion I started replying in Russian, and she said something like "why do you make me walk this uncanny valley
And in case of Crimea it's the protecting of russian minority in scale of whole Ukraine and majority in scale of region of Crimea.
I've read here on Reddit that you learn one subject for half a year and then it might never be resumed
A tiny possibility, maybe Lavrov doing a quick visit, would be if Estonia and Russia finally ratified the border treaty, but with Ukraine crisis, this has stalled as well.

How many places could he reach in an helicopter?
That way rule makers by themselves create incentives against effectiveness...
VimpelCom is preparing to open large office in Lviv, Ukraine

If you want to make a political division then "Central" makes sense, because it separates EU members like Poland and Hungary from non-EU members like Ukraine and Belarus.
If you watch statement of russian general Lebedev about invading Moldova, you will find it almost identical to statements about current Russian invasion in Ukraine.
Ukraine, with population of 45 million, is the largest country in Eastern Europe aside from Russia.
Putin is going to make Ukraine great again.
This is why he cannot allow strongman dictatorships to fail and if they do fail he cannot allow those countries to be successful - they must be as chaotic, impoverished and violent as possible.
Largely ceased to participate in CIS from 2014, and withdrew representatives from all statutory bodies of CIS in 2018 as a result of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and Russia's involvement in the War in Donbas
If they see an opportunity they will take action.
I went to Kiev, Odessa and Chernobyl in april of 2016.
The Baltics were brought up later, where he was completely wishy-washy about it, and gave no clear indication that he even knew what that term meant (reassuring, huh?
Yeah, it's even called "Putin - Fucker"
Otherwise it would just turn into western European countries hosting the contest all the time, which takes half of the significance behind Eurovision.
And I disagree with the sudden stop.
NATO would've been able to build up massive forces in Ukraine then.
To start a campaign will demand much more resources today for Russia and transport of logistics and material in such a size that UA and western intelligence would most likely have picked it up
It's true, but polish know, if Russian come, they never go back, they know history and 1769
You clearly name the stop you need; they start explaining something in a language you don't understand
From [Wiki]
Until Ukraine agrees to something else, and not at the point of a gun, Crimea is part of Ukraine.
They didn't shoot to kill tho, but they were aiming for legs - there were articles on that in Ukranian press in context of smugglers, and it was viewed (at least in Ukraine than) as common knowledge about what would happen if you try to run away when smuggling.
Sorry if this is too personal
I don't drink and don't like salo
And in terms of name complexity is pretty similar to the old one, so not much changed there

Someone wins elections, the next year he is the enemy of the people
Though he's against the main inheritor and paragon of Soviet idea in the modern world.
NATO is seen as a threat to Russia, so the fact that Trump is against it makes them really happy.
Overall, I can get what they are talking about
Except Ukraine has no control over the peninsula and also makes it very difficult for people to enter Crimea through its own territory.
There are fascist batallions in Ukraine (see Azov batallion and some others).
If it is near the Binnenhof (and it seems it is), then I saw such a performance with my own eyes
There is no way you can blame Ukraine for this.
I underestimated our poetry
Then he should get out of Ukraine.
They are trying to create bad PR for Ukraine.
If the country you live in has no Russian interrests treatened, you have nothing to worry about, The Crimea, Russian part of Ukraine where both Russian interrests treatened by Ukraine.
I don't give a shit
Slovakia due to similar culture, the majority religion and similarly terrible politicians.
Do you call your country Kievan Ukraine or just Ukraine?
Also Turkey has a symbol that is universally known.
Because *everywhere but in Ukraine* is NATO not happy with what's happening in Ukraine.
When Air Support is not involved, the frontlines are fairly static and artillery is king just like in Ukraine.
Every big player has done heinous shit.
Героям слава!
* And after that, they just say their Name+Patronymic or wave their hand saying it's fine to just use their name
Can't say it's fully economically autonomous, but the budget of AR Crimea is present in the budget system of Ukraine as a separate branch
Its not like western powers care much about the deaths they cause either.
Actually not, at least in Russian case.
We have almost full year on 20th century and WW2 is a big part of it
Bullshit, IMF money goes to National Bank reserves, they are not put into economy directly.
You shouldn't be annoyed by this, after all etymology of Austria is quite similiar
We have kalach, which is a rich white bread, kettlebell-shaped in Russia, Timoshenko's head-shaped in Ukraine.
Russia is proven to fake and instigate shit to smear it on ukranians since the maidan.
Justify is exactly the right word.
Taking neutral position in Trump impeachment
It's obvious there will be drama.
and that's for good
And Russia warned about possible air counter attacks from the 'separatist' side.
Also pre Russia-Ukraine conflict, though.
Word, I would love to visit Georgia
She was banned as soon as she became prominent enough to be noticed.
Do you think you can win in a fight
In Russian though, a lot more words are shared.
Yes, I have a box dedicated to my home clothes that include summer and winter items as well as clothes intended for doing maintenance work (e.g., painting a surface) or going to a forest
With Ukraine and UK following...
Ugh, same here and in Russia and Belarus, maybe except the fighting part.
> Insects in general are fairly resistant to radiation, but cockroaches are not
I wonder how this would look on an actual globe
Yeah, it is huge, me and my friend hung there for a half of a day and did not visited all the stuff
A lot of people there received Russian pensions and other social benefits, money was invested in Sevastopol city an so on.
The EU as a whole have been extremely ineffective and hesitant in reacting to Russia, with several member states opposing sanctions and military aid.

Conquering is way too expensive for Russia, controlling in some fashion is their goal (the low intensity conflict in Ukraine is how they achieve it there).
Montenegro says foiled Russian-backed plan to kill PM Djukanovic
We gave up 3rd largest nuclear arsenal, basically for nothing

The Dramatic Impact of Illegal Amber Mining in Ukraine’s Wild West
Either your prices are even lower than ours or that is a very mediocre ice cream
That name is already trademarked by Russia
But starting a WW3 by invading random countries?
You must surely be blindly oblivious to the obvious happenings in the region.
Ukraine for instance generates over 50% of its energy via nuclear power, and they are nowhere near the top.
Poland is an example, Romenia, Ukraine, Turkey will follow eventualy.
That, or you Fanta/nesquik will come from your water pipes just like in Crimea
**Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny** (Hetman of Ukrainian Cossacks)
Yes it works well, especially when Russia works to undermine NATO.
It's quite funny how eastern EU is considered poor while you have countries like Ukraine and Moldova right next door
More like repression, dictatorship and instability, really
To be honest, I 100% agree with you that Merkel and Juncker could have handled the European migrant crisis much better, but as I am myself an immigrant from Ukraine I am definitely not anti-immigration, quite on the contrary in fact.

Have you seen some of the camps that the refugees are stuck in ?
It really reminds me how it was in Ukraine (pardon the comparison!) - an unconnected, corrupt elite thinking they can get away with anything.
They identified themselves as Rusich.
In all such cases, new leaders were becoming Putin's personal enemies endangering his regime, and all of them ended in wars
When my husband and I still decided to go in, we were absolutely in awe of that beautiful ship and the way exhibition was built around it
Russia just took advantage of the situation and invaded Ukraine.
I felt extremely safe my entire time in Ukraine (solo male traveler), when I did find people I could speak English with they were incredibly kind, when I couldn't, there always enough pointing and gesturing one can do to figure things out.
If Brexit won't work out for UK, I think new political power will emerge and they will eventually become a member of EU again.

They hold supermajority in parliament and almost every top official position.
From his point of view the West/US broke the status quo by supporting the revolution/coup and by promising Ukraine that they can join the EU and NATO (same as in 2008 when the US backed Georgian government tried to take back South Ossetia (de facto indenpendent from Georgia and under Russian influence for some 15 years then) by force - they failed and were left alone by the US).

For instance, in my country hardly anyone even paid any attention to a certain far right party as it was a laughing stock, largely made up by the most common skinheads you can imagine with barely a high school education who struggle to say one coherent sentence, yet they got almost 10% in the recent elections.
Second of all, every opposition candidate there is as much pro- Russian as Lukashenka is
Specially considering how the EU works, do you really think that you can convince all the goverments to just give money to Ukraine ?

Purpose is only to spread hatred towards ukranians between russians and to try feed europe/us that Ukraine is the bad guy.
And Ukraine is buying gas via Europe, which is much cheaper than the "brotherly" price
Ukrainians have nothing to fight for.
CaspianReport did a peice on this after reading the Prisoners of Geography.
Congrats to citizens of EU
Russia has an unstable and backward economy so they fail to influence and control even their closest neighbours because Russia can offer them nothing except of soviet nostalgia.
They just happened to have nukes on their property that belonged to the USSR, which it left.
In the UK and Spain though, it's mostly limited to people from rural areas and a tiny amount of people elsewhere.
Minority schools teach russian as "Russian", not "Foreign".
It looks very different to human eyes, mountains are more distant
Then why did the EU chose Ukraine over Russia?
This is a direct communication to them, portraying Russia as a victim which worked so well for the Islamists.

In Latvia and Estonia the knowledge of conversational Russian is way higher (I'd say that at the moment it's close to 90% at least in Latvia), but the knowledge of Russian is dropping fast in favour of English in the younger generation (outside, of course, of those countries' rather large ethnic Russian population).

There is about the same distance from Copenhagen to Lviv as there is from Lviv to Luhansk.
Edit: Oh, they criticized the use of "w"s instead of "v"s. I was referring to people using the russian-influenced "Lvov" instead of the correct "Lviv". "Lwiw" and "Lviv" doesn't seem like a big difference to me honestly

At that time, part of the Ukrainian elite was gripped by nostalgia for the Cossack state, which was liquidated by Russia in 1775–1786
And to put a cherry on the top of this cake of grammatical madness, the words in our language can shift their meaning within sentences due to additional context, forcing you to switch the way you conjugate them and the words around them

Till now, both during the long campaign and these past few moths, he was repeating Putin's approach word by word on many chapters (Russia did nothing wrong in Ukraine, there should be no sanctions for innocent Russia, anti-EU and anti-NATO comments, stirring up tensions with close allies while being strangely friendly with Russia, whitewashing the russian propaganda and the meddling of its services in the internal affairs of other countries, etc.) and there are many signs that something is really fishy.

Spinning this as anti-semitism
There's a plenty of reasons to have a bad option on Putin and his oligarchs: from warmongering and war with Ukraine to threatening neighbors.

I agree that Bosnia as a state is the most dysfunctional one in the Balkans, if not the whole Europe itself with perhaps the exception of Ukraine and or Moldova, but I don't see Republika Srpska ever achieving any independance in the future -- the whole self-determination involving Bosnia appears to me just a way for its president to gather votes; it reminds me of how humilliating the attempt was a couple of nights ago with the train incident in Kosovo.
