In Bosnia we say *zet*
Tenks for det Čekia

I'm not sure if Bali offers that
Croatian is hard for non-native speakers
They would see this as “losing”, and people from the Balkans don’t like to lose
Right now it is 26°C so it is not bad and the weather will stay nice till sunday
Well, if we are being honest, Europe wanted to close outward border with Russia, so Greece and all other countries form a whole
Friend to friend however would say it's ugly, but I don't see that to be different in other countries
and how the people who brought it there would be capable of even using that thing or ever have the intention too
And all of the arms and volunteers, from your civilized countries, that curiously found themselves participating in siege and slaughter, against largely unarmed civilians -- I hope (I know) they sleep soundly at night
Here we go:
Fikret Abdić, the guy who had won more votes than Alija Izetbegović for Bosnia's collective presidency in 1990 but inexplicably forfeited the leadership of said presidency, formed a para-state of his own in Velika Kladuša during the war

The agreement decided that two entities within Bosnia would be created, those being “The Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina”, and “Republika Srpska”. They are basically two states within Bosnia and Hercegovina
The way it is pronounced and written it is almost alien
Meanwhile a Croat was fined 25€ for wearing a Croatian jersey the morning after the finals, in the Republic of Srpska entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Even during the halcyon days before the war (neighboring Croatia was already balls deep in conflict during the same time frame) you had Croat and Serb ethnic para-states in waiting
Given that the supply of places outweighs the demand and you're getting a free scholarship, a lot of people just go, do nothing at their host uni and save money
To Sunce = That Sun (Neutral) (but would mostly be perceived as male)
In what way would it prevent annexation by France
Ffs why are the jews always attacked

Our government is just terrible
Accomodation is not that much expensive when going to big cities
Other than that, I'm pretty cool with pretty much every city

Some people think Bosnia Serbia Croatia Montenegro slovenia and macedonia are the same thing
That church is probably built on the remains of a Roman forum, not that it has anything Roman in it left

Everyone gets uncomfortable when their idea of evil Serb hordes genociding everyone gets challenged
Not sure about you guys but freshly-wed city couples are expected to rent here as soon as they marry
To put this into perspective you don't see this in Europe at all
All of ex Yugoslavia actually
Netherlands also has the good ones like DnB and techno
My friend has known someone who was called Niko, but it's Croatian name from what I know
Old buildings are rebuilt all the time after wars
Why is that so

Tufahija
We don't have it here
It happens rarely now that I mix up the numbers like it was before but I still have that feeling that it is wrong and unnatural for me
Except for maybe in the touristic part of Amsterdam, east of the station
Something to be proud of
With Ukrainian and Belarussian I did not have a lot of contact
I also don't think that Croatia or Slovenia would profit from prolonging the war (perhaps attempting to gain more land

It has no text and it lacks a "climax" or drop because its just build-up with nothing to top it off, if that makes sense
Ahh I see Bosnia has none
I just compared that
Imo, I don't trust them as well, but I don't give a shit, as they alone don't have majority of seats, and can't do anything on their own
Every country has an official name for another country
Can confirm city surrounded by forests and live next on one
But first a shower and again a visit to the toilet
On top of that they trashed the place and there was broken glass everywhere
Well Bosnia and Herzegovina is a fairly hot country, cities in Herzegovina have had the Mediterranean climate for decades, cities like Mostar and Čapljina reach 40 degrees every summer for at least a few days, they average 50 tropical nights per year (temperature not going under 20° at night) so it's not a big surprise
Sometimes I joke that he married me because of food

That "buy like milk" reference was definitely an overestimation
Us normal people get along just fine
Well thanks it's nice to hear that from tourists
Because it's usually the poor that live outside the natural gas and city heating system zones and can't afford electric convectors
But seriously we would be pretty fucked(and more crowded) if it wasn't for you
I would also believe that group correlates with low/no education and poverty
That's 470m euros, what the fuck

I just don't like the people that live there
Police brutality is much smaller problem in EU than in the US

We also use names that are not related to any real place but constructed by playing with words
A total opposite of the typical stuff that enter the slang of the general population
Exactly this

Balkan is not insulted
It's a perfectly reasonable and logical question
Agree except for rental house or apartment
Lmao
I was hoping for a similar answer :)
That should be enough
Of course, we should absolutely raise questions about the elevated number of deaths caused by workplace incidents and overworking of mostly South Asian construction workers and possibly think about repercussions and boycotting but the comment you made definitely supports the wrong side

One possible alternative is "boli me uho" (my ear hurts)
It's almost the only thing the average European knows about Bosnia and Herzegovina
Most of Bosnia too
I mean in my head 'jebe mi se' refers to the thing which you don't care about
Italian has three articles too, il, la and lo which work similar to der, die und das (atleast as far as I remeber
Bosnia, Albania, Serbia and the European part of Turkey have lots of parts with only mosques

From other Slavic languages, Slovak is the most understandable

Dear people, I present you the Bosnia and Herzegovina
I try to visit each country and city and make friends
I still feel that "ben" is used for two things that are easily confused
In order to bring an end to the Bosnian War in the 90’s, an agreement was made between the “3 constituent peoples” of Bosnia

As for the other I honestly don't remember what we were officially taught
Funny thing is that the Qatari government is probably the most transparent and smartest in the way they spend their resources on their citizens in that region, what could man expect from the others then

In Bosnian it would be "majmun", meaning monkey, or "ludo a", meaning crazy A.
And I love it
Why did the Allies not declare war on the Komies too
You were opressed by Ottomans not Bosnians
But it has everything I need
It sounds weak compared to the comments they make towards each other lol
No true brother country, but I’d consider Austria, Germany and the US as very close friends of . We have a discusting trend of some people calling Turkey our brother nation which is just ridiculous
I know about these examples, but there seems to be more because
US has 8 times more people killed by police per capita than Finland ,first European country (except Luxembourg, that has 1 person killed but due to small population seems larger, still smaller than the US though)
Absolutely horrible
Sometimes I really do love EU regulations
Second or middle names are practically nonexistent here, but some names like ''Ana Marija'' are usually (and legally at least in the case of the Federation) considered as one name with multiple words
Of course, we should absolutely raise questions about the elevated number of deaths caused by workplace incidents and overworking of mostly South Asian construction workers and possibly think about repercussions and boycotting but the comment you made definitely supports the wrong side

Nice
Not only that, but refuses to move forward with the "Serbian ideology" in Bosnia

There was a support structure, and volunteers from various countries that also "helped out". Many of these countries are in the (so-called progressive) EU now, and it makes me salty thinking about it

Turks and Greeks tried to live together but that didn't go so well
There was no need and rules and regulations related to preserving the historical look and feel of old city centres prevented it
That Tito died in WW2 and was replaced by a Russian spy or that Nikola Tesla was contacted by aliens and by far my favourite: that the Bosnian pyramids were built by an unknown prehistoric civilistation and that they are some kinds of “energetic centres”. Also some people think that aliens helped them and that they hid in pyramids for some reason and a later civilization (also unknown) buried the tunnels under the pyramids for unknown reasons

But in high school nobody carried books and mostly carried only 2-3 notebooks so it was a way to relieve the back pressure
