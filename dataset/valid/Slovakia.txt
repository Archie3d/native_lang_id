The only people that i know and learned my native language(slovak) and speak it without the accent are from other slavic nations (for example Polish) but still you can hear it maybe not from the accent but from the choice of words

You wake up after night of alcohol in another country while having no ID on you

When indigenous population is white and christian - i mean if i would move to Tokyo and would adapt and integrate to local population i can claim after few years/and especially my children that they are Japanese, but we would never be part of indienous population, because our ethnic background and religious background is different - but we can try and integrate to become really great citizens, but we will never be indigenous population.
Is there any argument
Behind the scenes with with seals in Košice, Slovakia

I generally don't like sweet stuff thaat much, but with alcohol it's another level, especially with beer
In addition to that, what is "sharing history" in the early Middle Ages with Czechs is a bit complicated subject
