Mortadella, prosciutto crudo, cotto, speck, lardo

Napoli ain't Italy is a controversial phrase though, cause it's used both by neapolitans who looking at the current state of the city and looking at the rich past of the city wish that unity of Italy never happened to imagine an alternative future of Naples being a rich capital city, and also used by north italians to compare the current state of the city with northern cities where things work nowdays

Comunque ovvio che trovo più difficile capire il dialetto, ma per quento incomprensibile un accento può essere, quelli italiani sono incomprensibili (a livello assoluto un accento si capisce comunque, ma se prendiamo gli accenti come unica forma di misura, allora quelli italiani sono come il greco)
