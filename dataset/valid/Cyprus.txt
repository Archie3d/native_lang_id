My birthday = my treat
Note how those "exceptions" undo the entire provision of the Citizenship Law except when the parent has Turkish citizenship and arrived after 1974 (e.g. the second point allows the process of citizenship to go on for the Cypriot child of one foreign parent whose entry or stay in the northern part of Cyprus is otherwise illegal )
Thanks for answering

Actually when we discuss about our issue, Belgium always pops up in my mind and I think "oh we will be like Belgium,best case scenario"

In Greece I rarely use the front door so I don't tell him sth
That's called diglossia, and modern examples include Finland and Norway

At least two decades ago, we were growing with nationalist minded people

They don't want Turkey to have the right to invade
Cyprus and Switzerland :(
I dunno, I can understand having a small number of limitations on names, like reasonable length and nothing that is obviously harmful to the child, but I can't justify giving the government the right to decide which variant of my name I should have on my papers

I thought that if the disease ever comes to the Netherlands, we will be fucked
That would be extremely bizarre and some people would take offence
But that's not my main point: I am empathising with the people who had to forfeit their first citizenship in order to receive the one of their country of residence (because I am temporarily unable to exercise my right to vote, which is what happens to them irrevocably when they naturalise in a country that doesn't accept dual citizenship), and providing reasons as to why someone can feel like they have stakes in keeping both citizenships (because several people here aren't able to imagine how you may feel that way)

Yeah xD
So not really
The exception from this pattern would be the UK
Depends where you are from though
I guess the ordinary person would feel that the only benefit is the ease of travel
I don't think most parties have nationalist views like "Cyprus first" or "migrants should leave".
Cultural inertia in other words
I personally see it as pretty good

I think all EU member states have more or less the same economic system: [mixed economy] That's a capitalist free-market economy with a non-trivial amount of state intervention

Frankly, flags are a vital part of it
Between institutionalised bullying and loss of career opportunities and time-restricted scholarships, hardly anything to reminisce about while serving in the Greek Cypriot National Guard

> I remember hearing in the news that they were deemed a terrorist organization but that's just a matter of definition I guess
That's again something that makes it in the news distressingly often - the last few years have been marked by domestic abuse cases, family murders, suicides, and murder-suicides in Greek Cypriot families that were attributed to parental abuse that was made known to the authorities but no action was taken
However native greek speakers have an advantage when it comes to the th sounds since we use them both in our native language
As a side not there are no Turks and Greeks in Cyprus, we have our own culture and identity its called Cypriot

What's crucial for me is to have handbrakes (not that dreaded footbrake all bikes in the Netherlands have), and at least a few gear speeds

Greece: Agrees with GCs side
Both sides knew how *democracy* works way before the election/referendum date
That way both of the presidents will try to convince people from both communities

Copyright laws are counter-intuitive and a lot of normal social activities go against its provisions
Historically and socioculturally, I find more common ground with ex-Ottoman Empire places, so places like Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Israel/Palestine, Bosnia, Serbia, and so on

Under standard copyright laws (with minor jurisdictional variations), work you create during work hours belongs to your employer *unless* there's a different agreement in place - in a way, your university is not even aware of their true legal power, they could claim 100% without even passing a new regulation

Finally, Cyprus Police is more likely to let Greek Cypriot parents (compared to non-Greek Cypriots) get away with warnings instead of starting criminal investigations each time there's a report against them

QWERTY but because we have 2 less letters than the Latin Alphabet, the Q and the w are replaced by the Greek Question mark which is also the English semi-colon ";" and thr W is replaced with the ς, s that is usrd at the end of words (this letter is luterally only used at the end of words, but it's common because many words end in s)
