In Chile that is called a “Berlín”, although it has pastry cream instead
Not spanish, but I've heard an spanish version that sounds "natural"
I wonder what the URSS did in Europe between 1945 and 1994 that made people change of opinion
The Chilean slang is too noticeable to the point that just changing one word of his dialogue would have been enough to make the character seem Chilean
ITT: no one reads the damn article
that's bad
In that case, it was a clear win then
This, of course, is my opinion based on the different experience I have as coming from a Latin country
Italian is like ravioli (idk it has a lot of"i")
Here in Chile we use “Born with a silver spoon” or “Born in a golden crib”.
Denmark, i love the people, the culture , the cities, the language, everything
Cool, here in Chile, we normally say “Aló”, I particularly tend to say “Aló, si
Damn
Are your trains small af or you guys are giants in the UK
TIL, Scotland knows best
Stay strong
Here in Chile we also had protests against our shit government, but are on hold due to Covid

But that has fuck all to do with communism
Phonemic languages are the best
Oof
Iran, Turkey when China commits literal genocide of the uighurs: *I sleep*
Well, I always thought that Italian and French sounded good
I think much of this attitude comes from the fact that, as a country, the US has been deeply segregated, both racially and ethnically since its inception, this preventing a much greater national identity from occurring
Bueno, yo siempre pensé que el italiano y el francés sonaban bonito
Specially in Latin America
I'm impressed Spanish is so popular
Being from Chile, I’m used to 5-6 richter earthquakes, but after seeing pictures, you can tell that many buildings over there are very old and not prepared for this

Correct me plox
But I have to say that, at least in South America, we frequently mock the castilian accent, the typical "spanish accent" because the youtubers from Spain are very popular here
Iran, Turkey when France gets though on political Islam: **REAL SHIT**
honestly, would be funny if france was the only country that doesnt change, meaning that france itself is an insult
I disagree, I am learning German and it sounds a bit like English but with rrr and ä
I heard it in a song from "Residente"
En español también
"Chilean accent" probably :c
”. Sometimes “Hola” will suffice
Sadly, I saw how quickly reddit and the world forgot about it in a few days
Ich bin nicht sicher
Yet the US system has lasted longer than most european ones
So, from a forgotten country, I hope your protests work out and be succesful
They’re much easier to understand
For example, “zanahoria” (carrot), the h has no sound, but in “chile” the h has sound
Honestly, almost all of the Spanish in Breaking Bad is pretty bad

The USSR was a degenerated state, in no way represents my belief on communism or socialism, and Stalin was a genocidal maniac on the same level as Hitler in my book
"Chilean accent" probably :c
Russia delenda est
It's just based on comparing the situations

Spaniards speak good Spanish, but it sounds weird, to me the best Spanish speakers are Colombians and Venezuelans
Some phrases sound like they made a really good dialogue in English and then they translate it with google translate
That cornice looks gigantic
Don't quote me on this, but unlike my country or other Latam countries, I feel like white people in the US are more prone to feel close to the people of the country they have distant relatives rather than the racial and ethnic minorities from the US
Das ist richtig oder du bist recht
They are very common
When a friend or family member calls me, I say “Dime” or “Dígame”
Denmark, i love the people, the culture , the cities, the language, everything
Oh sorry I meant to say that in "general" our accent is commonly mocked
Also, expect aftershocks, which will be (normally) shorter and less destructive, even a few days afterwards, so don’t be scared if it happens, just try to stay away from windows
They are very common
Also the strange accent makes it more noticeable

South American here, you can hear very often parents calling their childs papito/mami

The EU, America and Japan should join against the risk Chinese hegemony

Can I be a communist and an anti-stalinist

What I don't understand is his dialogue, he doesn't use Chilean slang at all
That city looks lifeless
"Cabeza, rodillas, muslos y caderas" x2
People in first world countries like the US rapidly forget about struggles in "less important" countries, like yours or ours

Totally agree, Finnish also looks well when written down

I didn’t know they were “ancient-sounding” and in fact they sound kinda nice in spanish
That's why
It's very telling how irrational some of the anti-US hate is that we have german users blaming America for Crimea and Ukraine

This thread is super interesting to me because I know a couple of girls around my age (25 yo) with croatian ancestry who are named Katica and Slavica

As a Latinamerican, I've always found this so odd
I mean, most changes that people announce as world ending end up being mild annoyances
You can use it as a noun, verb, adjective, very much like kurwa

That's equality
Huh, then it probably was *an even older, 4 levels building before*, which was then expanded with two additional floors (leaving the oversized cornice in an odd position), balconies, a haussman roof and baroque style ornaments at some point, damaged and then now restored to its pre-war 6 floor state
Yeah, it looks better than before, but they went overboard

Those are in proportion though, and the larger one is the roof cornice; the one in this renovation was increased in size from the original one and now blocks the windows from the street view

There are exceptions too, my ex-gf’s name is Janja, which I think sounds horrible lmao

In spanish we have the letter “h”, which doesn’t make sound unless it’s next to a “c”.
As for the Gus Fring accent, I understand that the actor cannot imitate the Chilean accent, after all it is one of the most difficult accents in Spanish
