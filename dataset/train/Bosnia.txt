That's what's so shocking about the UK, insurance prices vary too freaking much, I'm sometimes glad it's a flat rate for everyone here plus a 50% discount if you've been driving for 3 years without an accident (it's progressive so you get 75% after your first year etc)

The *provocateurs* will continue posting their bullshit unabashedly
I don't and we are mainly Muslims but still act pretty much the same as anyone in Hungary or Austria, surely the mentality is a bit different from the Austrian one, but that has more to do in being abused by big empires, therefore less developed and encouraging people to find ways to "cheat the system" which was always the case, even in "peaceful and prosperous" socialist Yugoslavia (the 1945-1992 one) people still found ways to ensure that they get more of what was supposed to be "equality".

I only went out to go to the toilet, which was most of the day and in the night because I couldn't sleep
But I talk with an American accent
In Sarajevo, the attitude towards the people from the Sandzak region (part of Serbia with a significant Bosniak population) is that they are less cultured, more conservative, that they all dream of moving to the Bosnian capital and they all help each other when they get there
Most notably, they made everything transparent as it can get in that short amount of time
There's probably a lot of others, but these come to mind first
Yes, it's common here

No wonder Israel is being an asshole to everyone, this shit is happening to them for centuries
Smoking is far less prevalent among younger people here, is that the case in Croatia too
When something happens that's anti Serbian or anti goverment of the entity Srpska, it gets coverage on FTV and BHRT (which usually include both sides) and it gets buried in the RTRS chanel or gets the "they hate us, it's always our fault" treatment
It took only one day for the first attacks on non-Serbs
So all 3 sides downplay their bad deeds
Nevertheless he was really happy when he found out that the Austro-Hungarian Empire fell

I worked at an Italian restaurant here in Austria, my boss was Italian and I can remember a couple things he was disgusted about regarding order by customers:
No one cares about the original purpose of the holiday anymore, but the timing is just perfect -- mid-spring when it's not cold anymore but the heat waves haven't started yet either -- and you get two days off work so you don't have to worry about being hangover
Sarajevo was burned to the ground in 1697, between the 1660s and 1690s it had over 100k people and was around the 10th place in Europe's biggest cities

First it needs to be said that the door that everyone here is talking about aren't really self-__locking__ -- they're still  unlocked, it's just that the external handle isn't functional
For me, its my own hometown but then again if you mean historically - its a couple of cities, there cannot be only one most important city
But in high school nobody carried books and mostly carried only 2-3 notebooks so it was a way to relieve the back pressure
Which is funny

In Bosnia it's wether it's "burek sa sirom"(burek with cheese) or "sirnica" I think
It’s easy to say they were “liberated” by the “good guys,” but it’s hard to admit that life isn’t as black and white

I felt kind of crappy but okay enough to explore rain drenched Zagreb and it's mostly empty streets
It looses the entire meaning when translated
We just say ”halo”, which doesnt have a proper translation in English
If I asked to compare it to Bosnian no one would have a clue because you don't know how we call other countries
Just as a man can make a caricature, people have the freedom to voice their displeasure with it and protest in the confines of the law

In Tuzla, the city where I come from, I do not know anyone who gets offended for calling them Bosnians
Yes, it's one of the most prominent European hubs, the fully abolished tax on IT income makes it very competitive salarywise with some more developed countries and I've only heard the best about the city itself

How is EU "ruling" the countries when the member states control the EU ? How is this bill a proof that EU controls member states if member states all agreed on this ?
I know, you're not allowed to talk about Croatian war crimes among westerners
I am Bosnian actually
Yes always
It has to do how we as a whole perceive it in my opinion
Those that are highly educated end up leaving the country for more prosperous ones, like Germany
I just don't like anything that has to do with war
And if you're from the biggest city in your country that also has a significant part of the population, you don't move out :D
The station is also a 10 min bike ride away, and the train to Schiphol Airport takes 30 min, Amsterdam, The Hague or Rotterdam likewise 30ish min

Yes, it is also a valid answer, but only meat burek is exclusively Bosnian
People die because of war
Eventually you get your own villa in the southern part of the city

There is only one burek
I'm using terms that, when translated are closer to "that" than "the" because "the" isn't really a thing in Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian
Over here we have a Slavic accent if we don't work towards either American or British
Indeed
"Waterpolo is barely a sport" ... know from experience, or calling them Serbs :D
Well, are we wrong
Communist (well socialist in our case) housing (especially from the 50s and 60s) is considered top level building in Bosnia and Herzegovina, buildings with thick brick/concrete walls where you don't hear your neighbors at any time, no matter how loud they are
Dear people, I present you the Bosnia and Herzegovina

Also taxi drivers sometimes overprice
Jebe mi se za to (I want to fuck because of that or I am not really interested in that so I would likely fuck something instead) Now I am really struggling to translate this
Edit: what I found interesting is that the Welsh name for their country *Cymru* means *countryman* *from the people*. So you basically have two completely different  names and meanings for the same country
For some reason, *rare* is much more difficult than *rural* for me, but generally I agree the words with multiple Rs are worst words to pronounce
I'm using terms that, when translated are closer to "that" than "the" because "the" isn't really a thing in Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian

When I was a high school student, I had a discussion with a philosophy professor from Skoplje on Facebook and he had some interesting obscure German philosophers to recommend but holy mother of God, his views on history were Skopje 2014 down to a T.

I don't understand how 30 years after the war there is still this ethnic divide between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks

But the  thing here is that the 3 sides all point to the bad things happened to their people, while not focusing as much on the bad things their side did
I mean they're pretty chill they just take a few pictures here and there
I don't like burek (the only (meat) pie that should bear that name), I adore zeljanica though
We dont have fancy letters, well maybe a couple like ž š č ć đ dž lj nj, but our grammar sucks and everyone would hate it

I will include this althought it loses the entire meaning and it is hard to translate into English properly but believe it makes sense in Bosnian)
Next day I felt sick, but still okay
I much prefer to go to a festival with a varied and more alternative line-up and then explore any big city nearby

I know that cuts Croatia in two but it makes a bit more sense
The games are very well known

I think it's the definition of a national hero
We failed at that level
We read Tolstoy, Dostojevsky, Shakespeare, Goethe, Molier, Hugo, Kafka, Dante, Sofoklo, Krleža, Zola, Jesenjin, Servantes
Only Neum, but it doesn't have lots of history like nearby places such as Dubrovnik, Makarska or Split, so I'd rather visit those
Same here, would be a success
Most of Bosnia too
And all of the arms and volunteers, from your civilized countries, that curiously found themselves participating in siege and slaughter, against largely unarmed civilians -- I hope (I know) they sleep soundly at night
In Sarajevo, there are some billboards with citations from Quran and things Prophet Mohammad said

Calling the whole UK just Engleska is disrespectful to Scotland, Wales ans Northern Ireland
I guess the communist regimes did a good job at promoting celebration of labour
Turkish customs didn't really stick that much unless in very rural places and we are all much more Italian/Spanish than Turkish looking

And also a Bosnian who doesn't love Germany and everything from that country
Meanwhile in my country: tEsTInG isN'T a cUrE
I planned to go to Exit this year for similar reasons
I only know two people who actually say “rekao” and other verbs correctly
Small countries definitely do search in English as a lot of stuff isn't available in their languages
In Bosnia we have three main - tax funded* TV stations: BHRT (for the whole country, but is under political influence from the Federation), FTV (for the entity of the Federation) and RTRS (for the entity of Republika Srpska)

The younger generation tends to be more open but another factor that comes into play is the region where you are from
I agree, most of the time it's easy to infer from the context, other languages have this as well
Like what
Dalmatia should be south-eastern europe
I think it was my grandmother who mentioned to me that back in the days even as little kids they would get a glass of wine before school in winter so they feel a bit warmer
I flew to Ljubljana and spent a day and a half there
As a Bosnian I think it's pointless too
For example 'Schadenfreude' (which even got integrated into the English vocabulary) or many more
How could have you forgotten Stefan
Yugoslavia is back
This will not happen
Like yeah, it's an 'a', but not a regular a; it's a weird a. Duh
History was written all over Balkans, i.e. Belgrade is not more or less important than Sarajevo, Zagreb, Athens, Istanbul, etc
The situation is better between the younger generation but still this burden of war is there and it will be there for the next time unfortunately
I much prefer to go to a festival with a varied and more alternative line-up and then explore any big city nearby

I don't mean we should abandon our native language and start speaking English
Man, I am hopefully its getting to the Austrian level of diversity in next 4 years
Every sound has it's letter and how you say a word is exactly how you will spell it
Really great stuff, a big party live with Dutch and Turkish fans in the front jumping around
Someone even tries to deny the Bosnian nation, language, histroy etc

I will be honest with you
I've only had rain and cloudy days the last two weeks

Well you have the only city with two clubs who both won the UEFA Champions League (AC Milan and Inter)

But it's the main topic being either ignored by the Serb side or being pushed too much by the Bosnian and Croatian side in discourse online and offline
My languages is phonetically consistent so that was for me the most challenging part
Since then, I always make sure to say "jag vill ha sex stycken", or buy five or seven items :)
The amount of things they contributed to our modern western world is astonishingly high for a relatively small country
Let us in, let us in
They have 3 million cases
yea so do we, they’re only used in official documentation, like birth certificate, bills or your deathcard
For anyone thats not familiar with the Bosnian War - think of the scenario as an influental Jewish army leader who worked alongside the Nazis
Well to be honest (in my opinion) it would not take a long time to make us economically stable
And Greece didn't have an aristocracy
First of all, I think you can't put Bosnia in there because I doubt there wasuxh profit from us, considering that Serbia was much better equipped than us
The fact of the matter is, that as long as we keep our current system, the entire country loses
Doesn't feature autotune, mumble rap and other bullshit
Felt it here in Bosnia woke me up this morning
Honestly, what French food besides baguettes and some cheeses is popular in the Netherlands
It would just be handy to be able to use one word to refer to several types of bones without having to list all the specific names not to confuse it with legs
Tuzla
We like you guys, Croatians too
Also, what war song
Let me just add that the Balkans too, use “kurva” but it means “wh*re” not “f*ck”

It literally means shoe soles and makes absolutely no sense
My parents fled the war in the 90s so I was born in a different county
Husein Gradaščević aka Dragon of Bosnia
That's basically the only reason why opposition won

There is currently a lot of illegal immigrants from middle east  in Bosnia and  I hope Europe reacts fast because after all of these events that are happening I have a bad feeling that this will just be the beginning of attacks

Bosnia : 2003
It's capitalism without oversight on steroids, and criminal behavior isn't punished by the powers that be, they in fact take part in it
I mean honestly, listening to Dutch I think I can understand little more than I would listening to some Swiss dialects (I live in Southern Austria)
These Steves are long dead but you can read their names on medieval charters or coinage to make sense of what they would have called themselves in their own language (the name of the language would be another contentious topic)
Bestragija (without a trace place)
I'd say Montenegro gets the least data
I'm surprised British kebab shops do this
For me, its my own hometown but then again if you mean historically - its a couple of cities, there cannot be only one most important city
Sentiments like “Vote for my party, we can’t give the Bosniaks/Croats/Serbs too much power
TBH the economy started getting better before Covid and the political stuff is actually getting better every day, only outsiders think that something will happen and Serbians pity us for some reason, even if they're not better developed at all

It was greatly influenced by TV (Disney channel) and I could not be happier that I have it

Tvrtko I of Bosnia
"The land of foreigners" sounds cool tho

We failed at that level
Because it supports Serbian Orthodox Church and Milo advocates for the equality of all religions in Montenegro since different ethnic groups live in Montenegro
They want to end normal life and replace it with fear as a punishment for the insults
The most popular ones in Bosnian would be:
"Puši ko Turčin" - "smokes like a Turk" smokes a lot
How they tried to describe the world, I could listen to this all day long
It is impossible for croatian
Reason for the fine was the jersey and it being provocative and looking for trouble

Young and educated people came to political scene

I don't remember any famous ćevapi from Croatia
North Macedonia
On that point I wonder why none of the Italians have mentioned 'The four seasons" by Vivaldi, I'd guess a great percentage of people at least would have heard parts of that

Bosnia doing its part too
You get +3 charisma if you have that Apple logo on your phone
Why should this be celebrated
Vucic and his supporters are extremely homophobic
Probablt correct, BogauCelo
Ok that is hilarious
"Official English name used by the UN". The way the UN lists countries is in a way official
However, the Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to support abolishing our Tri-President system
However, these days the system leads to high levels of corruption, and a political system that promotes division instead of unity
True, except while driving, expect the unexpected if you're driving in Albania :D

nije kod nas ko kod zapadnjaka jbg
There are people here, on this subreddit, that downplay, justify, or outright celebrate these things
Yet, still we live in same country as they do
But comparing English with languages that are spoken just in one country it's apsurd
both sides are at fault here
I like raves but Ibiza, Mallorca etc
Oh boy, you're in for a treat
If you ask me I guess it is a cognate
Turkey loooooves *Turkey* lol
Well there are no regulations here on how you should behave in a roundabout, there are recommendations and stuff but you don't lose points for driving in the outer line, only if you don't stop or cut ahead of a car that's already in

As a Turk who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina
The reasons people call us brothers for, given our history, are disgusting
Well that's their problem
Reason videogames
We have it in Bosnia too
Because Greek fanatics got crazy and started killing Turkish people in Cyprus
Oh damn so many bad memories from that shit, it's still in programmes here
It's normal here too so they might be Balkan
Sorry, again
would also add things like brate/bra, abi and habibi which all were brought up by immigrants (Ex-Yugoslav, Turks and Arabs in these cases) and are in common use for German/Austian young people
Completely different from the official English name used by the UN and what does it mean
It's like the Neudeflat of Groningen
The only thing resembling a locker I ever had was in kindergarten, it was a locker where we would put our jacket and shoes for the time we were in kindergarten
One of our presidents, yes you heard it right presidentS claims that Bosnia and Herzegovina isnt a legitimate country

Not as fancy as the other museums mentioned but I really like [the national museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]
That's kinda a lot to drive

Mostly prople that are nostalgic about Yugoslavia and support the pan-Slavic idea
That along with Drasko being elected as mayor of Banja Luka made a huge impact and shake-up on political scene
There was an if only moment
Greece searching ,,how do i get a loan
Umm it's not common
Thought the same about serbian
I was pretty bummed when Croatia lost in the WC Final
With Serbs and Croats it is another story
Hugs are great
As a Turk who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia
When something happens that's anti Serbian or anti goverment of the entity Srpska, it gets coverage on FTV and BHRT (which usually include both sides) and it gets buried in the RTRS chanel or gets the "they hate us, it's always our fault" treatment
One thing I find bothersome with Swedish is that the most common things are sometimes called the same

Fikret Abdić, the guy who had won more votes than Alija Izetbegović for Bosnia's collective presidency in 1990 but inexplicably forfeited the leadership of said presidency, formed a para-state of his own in Velika Kladuša during the war

So big and so empty
What does the word "an" mean
A Bosnian who doesn’t like Burek and Chevapi
First one that comes to mind: Not recognizing Kosovo
The problem is that the political leaders in the Balkans are nowhere near the best, and I highly doubt that these issues will be solved completely
I live in a rural setting though, but I talked to my peers who grew up in cities and it seems like the age where they start walking alone has quite moved up there, too
