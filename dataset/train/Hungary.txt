Paying the expenses of the royal family is a drop in the bucket compared to national budgets, and it's not like you wouldn't have to pay similar expenses in a republic either (hell, even former presidents are entitled to a pension for life and other benefits, which can get up to the level of the expenses of the royal family considering the term limits - if the presidents are elected at a relatively young age, the state can end up paying pensions to 5-6 of them).

You should add that it was written in the beginning of the 19th century (by Ferenc Kölcsey); but its style is even intentionally older to avoid censorship, so that Habsburg officials couldn't say it was complaining about the contemporary system

No one bats an eye, if you say "I don't like people from <insert random country>" (just ask you why, at max), but if you mention that you "don't like africans/slavs/gypsies/jews/arabs/etc.", people can likely go apeshit (mainly those who tend to be leftists according to political views, but not necessarily).

A lot of times in the EU certain good legislations (1989-Social Charta, Joint Eropean Forces act [I donno the original name of that legislation], the first common ID law[EEU]) didn't come into act, because the UK refused to sign it, while every other nation did

As of today, we are struggling together under a pathetic excuse of a government, and I can only hope that we can get rid of them sooner or later
The ALDE candidate in my city spends his entire day spamming racist shit and anti-Hungarian remarks on Facebook, which is pretty funny because he's ethnically mostly Hungarian, but he keeps it in secret and poses as a nationalist Romanian.
While there are some exceptions who do well without animal, it is much more easier to just eat meat.
He introduced German as official language in all of his empire, which directly sparked the national reawakening of Hungarians among others

Many German cities have cracked down on airbnb - I don't know if there's any federal legislation, but in Berlin, for example, you're not allowed to rent out an entire apartment without a permit and it's really hard to get a permit because the city fears it would lead to gentrification (plus as soon as there's a permit involved, most people don't want to bother or are afraid they might inadvertently break the law).
The only long term solution is a federal Europe where national governments can't do politics that only serve them to keep them in power, but the only existing single government represents the whole of Europe as a single unified unit
