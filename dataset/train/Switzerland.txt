I find German extremely elegant: the spelling is phonetic except for a handful exceptions (such as "eu" being vocally rendered as "oi"); the case-based grammar allows you to construct extremely long sentences without any ambiguity about subjects/objects, and with free word order (except for the position of the verb); the language embraces the sub-sentence-ing (I really don't know how to say it in English, but in German we separate sentences much more into sub-sentences separated by commas) which allows you to bundle thoughts easier into discrete chunks without splitting them up (which can adversely affect flow); the vocabulary spirit allows you to get creative and create endless word combinations ad hoc (not just for bureaucratically condensing information, but also for humour, slang, etc
