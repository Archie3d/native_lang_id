Pedro the I had the cognome of the "o justiceiro" = the just (more like the punisher) tldr he loved a girl but the king and the Royals didn't like, they got her killed by buying killers, when he became king he brought the killers to justice made them kiss the hand of his dead lover corpse, and later they were executed, he also crown the corpse because she was his true love and so she deserved to be his queen), we also learn about important events that shape our history and global and European history like our sea adventures, colonialism, slavery, the Lisbon earthquake that literally changed European philosophy and architecture, we learn about the development of technology advancement in automation like the printing press and fabric we learn about the lousy deals that our monarch had with the British that destroyed our economy and industry for literally centuries, we also learn about the French revolution since it was the turning point of modern history, a bit about the American history, the French inventions and our success at beating them and defending our ground, then the events of the 19 and 20 centuries

The eyes of the world were turned to Germany and her allies in the 40's. They were either (most commonly) viewed as "The Evil Villain" or, in the case of Italy and Japan, "The Great General". There were WAY too many witnesses to Germany's war crimes to just cover it up

I've never heard a foreigner use the word esquilo tbh
It's quite clear what is the purpose of Russia Today.
It's definitely a place I'd like to go back to one day, and hopefully I'll get to explore the other boroughs too

My apologies

Wtf is happening to Portugal
It mostly happens because either they think Spanish is our language or that is similar enough that we understand it better (and most times they speak trashy Spanish to you)
We sold metals like volfrâmio to both sides during ww2
We use this especially with languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Mandarin, etc
The AfD's core electorate won't but the protests votes might.

I see a trend going on

Trouxeram-me uma lágrima ao olho
Portuguese: 100% (my first language)
How naïve I was
The word "Saudade" only exists in Portuguese
Was gonna say something, but then i saw your flag and flair
And second, the bigger problem is that the EU doesn't really have powers to stop national governments doing stupid shit.
Why portuguese should become the next pan-european language: it would make us more popular, then more tourists would come, then our broke country would make more money
Man that must feel good
As an irreligious person, to those saying Fuck all religion:
I've been to Tuscany and it's so beautiful.

For example, people don't have a clue about how cool and advance our air traffic management system is, it can almost automatically coordinate flight departures based on the current weather and forcast, you can get an aircraft to get you of a stand at 11:50 and have on arrive at the same stand at 11:55 without any delay
If you know Spanish we can probably understand you and most people will try to communicate anyway, but just make it clear you’re not assuming the languages are the same
Also, the Spanish (Castillians?) feared Catalonia would fall to French hands, meaning they would have a passage through the Pyrenees over to the Iberian peninsula.
I recall with a deep sense of nostalgia a prime minister we had that praised some nordic minister that resigned because she FORGOT to pay a 50 euro licence for a pier on a property she owned
Otherwise, people just bought the notebooks they liked the best
I'm half-Portuguese, half-British, specifically Scottish

It wouldn't be the same vote though, it wouldn't just be leave or stay, it would be this deal or stay, now that people how the country can actually leave, all the things that will change they have the right to decide since they were told something very different

A new tax on sugary drinks, an increase in the tax on tabacco and alcohol, a special property tax for luxury real estate (more than 1 million €).

Also Aracena in Andalusía is pretty and has cool caverns
It is so short-sighted and angry, just like Trumpers who some of the "Brits" on here probably are anyways.

Then actual history of the country first the political climate of the reconquista and how the country was formed (the history of our first King was really badass i recommend people reading it you will enjoy it) then the military exploits against other reconquista kingdoms and the moors kingdoms, the expansion, Portugal was the first to end its territorial expansion in 1200s having the oldest consistent boarders in Europe (and that's a big achievement considering European history), we also study about the British and their help during the reconquista and against the other kingdoms that then lead to the creation of oldest alliance in the world still active (Portugal and England alliance), then we study the dynasties in general sense and giving special attention to the most important monarchs and their achievements (a good way to remember was by their cognome which is basically a nickname given to the king or queen an their deeds for example D. Pedro the I had the cognome of the "o justiceiro" = the just (more like the punisher) tldr he loved a girl but the king and the Royals didn't like, they got her killed by buying killers, when he became king he brought the killers to justice made them kiss the hand of his dead lover corpse, and later they were executed, he also crown the corpse because she was his true love and so she deserved to be his queen), we also learn about important events that shape our history and global and European history like our sea adventures, colonialism, slavery, the Lisbon earthquake that literally changed European philosophy and architecture, we learn about the development of technology advancement in automation like the printing press and fabric we learn about the lousy deals that our monarch had with the British that destroyed our economy and industry for literally centuries, we also learn about the French revolution since it was the turning point of modern history, a bit about the American history, the French inventions and our success at beating them and defending our ground, then the events of the 19 and 20 centuries
