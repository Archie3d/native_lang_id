What will happen is that the profile of the speakers of Camões' language will change a lot: first it was a primarily Portuguese language, then it was dominated by a Brazilian majority, and now we will see African countries (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe) having a Portuguese-speaking population larger than Brazil and Portugal combined
These are two different cases: the colonization of the African countries was done in a system where the Portuguese went with their entire families and did not mix, in the case of Brazil, as the technology was more rudimentary, only the men came and they got together with the native women (obviously, if you are a man you can understand their situation: they would leave an extremely Catholic and conservative country with extremely coy women and no habit of bathing to arrive in a country full of beautiful women, naked, clean and shaved after having spent months in dirty places full of men, only having masturbation to relieve sexual tension

Hell, you could take advantage of the fact that it was fought over such a long period of time and have a bunch of different storylines with different characters all throughout the different conflicts, playing both English and French nobles, but also peasants, knights, and merchants
This generated a huge mixed population, which we call here Mamelucos, children of Portuguese and Indians
EDIT: My point on nationalism is not a criticism on our love for the place that we belong, but to these right wing/populist politicians that use that kinda of love that we had to close the doors of comunication between nations by attacking other natiions or creating old tensions

Just for your information the negative anomaly of the cold day 2 weeks ago was bigger than the positive anomaly of these "hot" days have been, so factually days like today is more close to what an average winter day should be than the freezing cold of 2 weeks ago, you guys should see the average temps from your place before using biased personal perception as facts, especially when your biased perception is clearly out of touch with reality

Don't know if it counts (since I've never been in any of the countries cited), but, I've already realized that the French do not dress like those fancy people drinking coffee outdoor in a Parisian restaurant as you may see in movies, not all Germans are pale, blonde and blue-eyed, not all Italians are dark-skinned and brown-eyed like Sicilians nor look like Mario Bros, the average Portuguese do not look like Pedro Álvares Cabral, Finns are not Mongolic, the Scots do not wear kilts all the time, the English do not have weird teeth, not all Irish people are pale, have freckles and are redheaded, etc

hey I'm not the one propagating an ideology of hate & exclusion
Not necessarily
I know it's a romance language, I'd just never seen it written before
Our scapegoats to blame for the Brazilian poverty usually are our own culture (there is the belief among some of us that we are a country of thieves and liars), politicians and sometimes the USA for Operation Condor
So I am reassured

A Portuguese standing for Brazil, now that's something new '-' Of the many flame wars on the internet between our people it's refreshing to see someone with a different opinion
P.S.: What happened here in Brazil was that the native indigenous population went through a genocide: either the populations that did not accept the Portuguese presence were killed by the Portuguese and their allies, or the populations that accepted the Portuguese presence mixed with the Portuguese colonizers through marriage and sex

These are two different cases: the colonization of the African countries was done in a system where the Portuguese went with their entire families and did not mix, in the case of Brazil, as the technology was more rudimentary, only the men came and they got together with the native women (obviously, if you are a man you can understand their situation: they would leave an extremely Catholic and conservative country with extremely coy women and no habit of bathing to arrive in a country full of beautiful women, naked, clean and shaved after having spent months in dirty places full of men, only having masturbation to relieve sexual tension
