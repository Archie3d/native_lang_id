Palatalization in particular has had a pretty profound impact on the sound of northern Scandinavian
Heading there in one month - can't wait
Omg já
Maps without Iceland
But who cares
Duisburg is the first I've never heard of
Everyone in Iceland knows Gothenburg (or Gautaborg as we say) mainly because of the football team and because of the number of Icelanders who move there (this is the case for many Scandinavian cities)
A few people are climate change deniers but they are few

Political matters are almost never religious
I'm very curious, do the Danish teach anything regarding Iceland
How much did you win
I guess so
You should stop eating so much chocolate, it's not good for you
I kind of like how Iceland is excluded from European maps
Almost all (outside) doors lock automatically, but I very often leave mine unlocked during the day if I’m passing through the door often and don’t want to risk leaving the key inside
We could put them on the largest and most populous island Iceland has, Vestmannaeyjar, and then just forget about it
Ljós=light(as in brightness)

The Hafnfirðingur interpreted it that he had to open the milk right then and there in the grocery shop, and did so
Btw
Nice, tshirt weather
Global warming is f*cking our sh
We don't have very cold winters, or very hot summers
And when it comes to the town and villages in Iceland the fishing village of Thorlakshofn is both ugly and a pretty worthless place to visit
Because of the loaning system we have due to the instability of the Icelandic króna, indexed loans and non-indexed loans
Hope you are doing ok as well

From an engineering perspective it is quite cool, one of the few places I've been to that really makes you appreciate the engineering of the classical era
.Also maltextrakt which isn't exactly a soda but is kinda similar to one, its somewhat similar to kvass and you can mix it with appelsín for a classic christmas drink
There’s been plenty of snow

The Iron Price is Right
So do I, but every once in a while you get the urge to leave for somewhere else
Yeah, it’s incredibly tough for a non-Icelander to read Icelandic and it’s much harder to comprehend someone speaking it in my opinion
We could use some more trees
We don’t believe in Santa Claus
There are two things to consider
WTS snow, most snow for a few years now here in north of Iceland
You cant even make 100 in iceland

The fact that this gift-argument is the only one you have illustrates the situation well
hehe
It's a tongue in cheek reference to the greatest version of Austria, when it was under the [Habsburgs]
Oh we're very crafty, you should see all the Chinese and (native) Indian costumes that have been made up here from something your mom/brother/granny had
Hæ, ég heiti Jón, það er ánægjulegt að kynnast þér. Hvaðan ertu (ert þú) ?

They have entire articles on this
The economy is going to take a massive hit
Im gonna be wearing tshirt and maybe shorts here in iceland
The range is pretty huge, with the lowest estimates being around 8% and the highest at 40%. It is however clear that even at the lower end, significantly more of the country was covered in trees
Of course the correct word would be emigrant, but expat describes a similar situation
Especially, how to spot people who are leaning that way, and should NEVER under any circumstances have a say on how to run the country
I would not want to live in such a country

Not very wow fact but we’re the most peaceful country in the world according to the global peace index and have been since it began
Who hates the swiss
I hate fish and norway (Icelandic btw)
Danish/Norwegian are also fairly easy to me, Swedish less so
Not sure about Sweden though, anyone know if the hype real about how unsafe Malmö and parts of Stockholm are
If it's an informal gathering, then the host usually has more than enough drinks for himself at least, but most will bring something anyway
There's also the "hv"- pronunciation in the southeast where a distinction is made between "hvalir" and "kvalir", a rather conservative pronunciation, but it's also rapidly dying out

Because i live in a utopian capitalist country with no millitary, almost no crime and poverty, with everything to fix poverty
Fun fact: Iceland was the first country to recognise Lithuanian independence in 1991
Hahah I would say pretty accurate from my experience at least, plus every time I went to Greece, the garbagemen went on strike
But again I dispute your premise that 'we' are only discussing pronunciation here
It is characterised by a rather clear pronunciation of p,t and k. People speaking with "harðmæli", for example, make a distinction between "sóti" and "sódi, which speakers of "linmæli", the vast majority of Icelanders, do not
Sharks are fish
I remember seeing this photo and feeling a sense of dread I haven't felt before
Thank you, but Icelandic does not sound soft or pleasant
For me Swedish is decently understandable written but I doubt it's the other way around for you
They just say 'This is I' and 'It is I' is grammatically correct, but enough people say 'This is me' now for it to be the most common form and as such accepted
In spoken language both are used
Feel this way too
Male nicknames here often ends with a "i" sound
There are of course some icelandic idiots that drive off road but mostly it's tourists that I hope just don't know any better, but some people just don't care

Phew, good thing they removed the eagle, now no one can see who built it
Since the slaves were captured and brought to Iceland in 800-1000 CE (and probably some Irish settlers being assimilated), there has been weirdly nonexistent relationship between those two relatively close neighboring countries
Alþingi is the oldest continuous running parliament in the world (with a slight pause mind you) and before it moved to Reykjavík like everyone from the countryside did, for the longest time it was held at Þingvellir, you could move the capital there
That's a weird distribution
Because Iceland didn't have trees large enough to build ships it was forced to accept the mostly unilateral terms that the king set them, but contrary to popular myth before the monopoly trade there was quite a lot of trade with the English, French and Basque whalers that traversed Icelandic waters
signing Gamli Sáttmáli in 1262 with Norway, it's all been downhill from there
The fight never ends

We can read texts from 1000 years ago easily, and I once saw a YouTube video by a Norwegian linguist, where there was a conversation between two people in what they reckoned was in old norse
Personally I think all drugs should be legal and regulated, or in the very least be decriminalized with a huge focus on harm reduction and pure substances
I’m half Icelandic half English per se but I am Icelandic
In Iceland the 6th of January is called Þrettándinn (meaning the thirteenth) because it's the thirteenth, and the last, day of Christmas
Other important factors are the "Little Ice Age", frequent volcanic eruptions, and the chopping of forest to make charcoal
“Last week when you killed my dog”
Jólakötturinn is a cat who eats people who don't get new clothes at Christmas

I guess Iceland isn't in Europe
And even then, they really don't look like it in real life
This is like reading a YouTube comment section
I agree
Faroe Islands on the other hand, every village seems to have a new dialect of its own

No it really doesn't. A mountain range covered by snow looks nothing like a glacier
