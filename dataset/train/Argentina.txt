I'm a Spanish native speaker but from Argentina
And [here] a comparison between the average argentinian vs italian (to me they are very different, as it seems italians put the emphasis one syllable before us, and and the intonation for the end of the words seems to head much more "upwards", and jumps up and down more, if that means anything to you)

I think in some culture people either feel embarrassed about it or believe their kids would do exactly as told just because they said so, which is obviously not the case, no matter how religious the family is, if kids want to have sex they will do it, if not at home, at an hotel, or a car, or a friend home,... or the school, or while camping--- you get the idea
That said, the dude that was on the car and something about a game (it was a famous video) was way worse for me

Here in my country no one would put a partner in a different room (agree is silly) but although it happens, its rare to have sex (Afaik, I do not speak for everyone) in a "family house".

Yeah, I meant most of the bakery in Buenos Aires is very similar or comes from Germany
