It is, if not more, as diverse as the whole of Europe

Infact, it was established through DNA tracing, that they were ones who first bought tobacco plantations to the subcontinent

Aap kaha se ho
rather I have seen many people, especially right wing, justifying the genocide, saying China is doing this to prevent terrorism as "all Muslims are terrorists". I don't think anyone have publicly supported it, but I have seen people making posts and comments supporting it
Again, arbitrary
The Romans were actually pretty lenient when it come to enforcing social and cultural norms on their colonies
So what the portugese did in mainland Europe was they wedded off Catherine of Portugal to Charles the second of England; and getting parts of insular land in the Indian peninsula as dowry while the portugese controlling the main and larger ports on the coasts

The Romans were also keen learners who often encorporated the culture of their colonies, namely Greece, into their own culture, and that's how Hellenic culture emerged
You guys have your own Boris
I guess it might be a difference in climate
But the book I was reading, The Roman Republic by Michael Crawford, seemed suggest that it began with the interaction between Romans and Greeks in the 3rd century BC
But I don't how much it would affect the publishing costs
>"If one looks at the two centuries between the Second Punic War and the age of Cicero, the impression is of an enthusiastic borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills, slowly leading to the emergence of a developed Latin culture; the central period of Hellenization of the Roman oligarchy was precisely the period when it was locked in escalating internal competition which finally destroyed the system

Was there not a referendum that said that Crimea overwhelmingly wanted to be part of Russia
Eventual days were hell because the social , societal norms are the opposite in my country although asian communities are tight-knit
Brace yerselves, lads

you made indian farmers in bihar and bengal grow that opium instead of food
How do you carry books ?
He seems more like a Putin loyalist,he probably agreed to this new government overhaul
Outside of the Peace prize, there is also, in general, a bias towards Western countries because Soviet Union should have received much more
So is the treasury just really full right now
That's fine cause you guys got real bands
Guess we're all doomed :(
I likened that place when I went to attend an underground music festival when I was backpacking in 2017

Jews tend to do well and people supposedly dislike this
I can't say I really understand the Crimea debate
If we somehow knew for a fact that the majority of Crimea wants to be in Russia, then what reason would there have been to stop them
hexagonal France, brick Nepal, dicknballs Sweinland are all great, but my absolute favorite shape on the map is Czechia
I think waiter/service industry not being thrilled is very common in Europe for some reason
For Belgium/Holland, tell them Czech beers are the best
always forget the branch that starts in middle english, instead of before Old English
If it originated in Italy shouldn't they have named it Bambini
"Slutstation" is my favorite
The girl looks like Sophie Turner
Aside from the obvious aesthetics of the term, it's cool that it also comes off as the land of Sweyn/Sveinn
Well done
Ah shit here we go again
I'd also like to hear the doctors/nurses point of view
Wouldn't the Austrian government interfere ?
Patricks day
(Honourable mentions: Portugal and Russia)
I was only suggesting that the statement about the map being 'easier to look at' is mistaken
But was this the most popular genre ?
Did the Ottomans one time commit a huge massacre in Armenia
How much did you carry ?
It sucks
Oh, thanks
THE LIST GOES ON
I still call it Czechoslovakia
I'm almost expecting outrage against this to take the form of stopping immigration or deportion
Whenever I see such situations transpiring, I always feel gratitude towards our constitution and it's drafters
Interesting how similar it is to Bengali [char] (fourth)

If we used it in our school they'll penalize us for using school electricity lol
Why would they move

Umm, you do realise that North is not 'up' right
I thought "pirate" was more Scouse
Yes
What's the reference here
But is is expected from them to appoint women ? Like informal quotas
I think that there is some international law about self-determination or something
That song from Katri Helena sounds very Russian
For the most part, they allowed the local elites to rule the colonies under the supervision of a Roman governor

These guys tend to be way more relaxed in intergenerational relations than we are
What are circoli and osteria
When I'm using the term "Hellenic" I'm referring to a particular period of Greek history which oversaw the borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills and resulted in the formation of a Graeco-Roman society
That does sound like a big problem but in the event that the people of Crimea do actually want to be in Russia then to be honest I don't see that much of a problem
Ah ok, got you
What about Russia, playing as a part of the Russian Mafias
In ten years it is

We have a few good prog bands that are a mixture of indian classical + rock/metal
An American economist called Thomas Sowell has a video on it
And still, people just know curry, Bollywood and brown people
Stealing from the biggest scam in history is basically the best reason
Yeah, ameya
The argument therein is that, post revolution, families had to offer each son a fraction of the father's land, and therefore tried to avoid having an abundance of sons to avoid dividing the land up into less and less efficient strips
Bangladesh
>but of course no one seems to complain about us taking Saddam down a peg in the First Gulf War
Is something like this found in the near east or China ?

I've heard that the benefits of modern industrial society came to Iceland much later than elsewhere in western Europe
India says hello

What happened with those I wonder
Russia helped a LOT in industrialization of India after independence
:) Reminds me of the russian song "Those were the days" from Mary Hopkins
Stupid hypocrites
Cool and covid positive
Here you go
Russian propaganda and one absolute madlad
Isn't the correct way of putting it, that Hitler was a Volksdeutsch who thought it was awful that there wasn't a country for all Volksdeutsch, and so he took power in (Klein)Deutsches Reich to create the Grossdeutsches Reich at all costs
Thanak you for explaining it
Same for adults
And still, people just know curry, Bollywood and brown people
Is that true outside of Dublin as well
and we have some russian influence on our Constitution as well, if not much
They never showed this part of King’s landing
Most excellent and sharp depiction of modernization that I have seen in a long time
What a strange post
What the fuck are you on about
>To my knowledge, later students got their books split in smaller tomes, so they could carry only 1/3 of the pages to school

Medvedev,right
In terms of raw numbers, Germany has the 3rd highest amount behind the US and UK
it was a proxy war through pakistan, a country ruled by a religious fanatic president that tranferred all the weapons to the fundamentalists instead of ahmed shah masood
Are they protesting
It seems so only because you are used to looking at it that way
I just moved to a bigger city (earlier lived in a small village) in Germany and the difference in the demeanour of strangers while commuting is very different
Maybe the Romanians don't travel much outside of Romania that much, so I feel maybe that restricts their view of the world
That's based though
Same shit
Noice
East vs West Germany
AFAIK, this was also the case for western Czech Republic
Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks etc moved to Turkey en masse while Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Syriacs etc settled in the Balkans or the ME
Oof, (I laughed at that)
I have always maintained that people kicking a ball around or hitting a ball with a stick are vastly less important than doctors, researchers, scientists, engineers, journalists etc who are doing things that actually matter and make a difference to humanity, and the government needs to redirect via taxation their money to more important fields
Mate, the very concept of a continent is fuzzy
The Archbishop's middle name is Kardinal
Stupid hypocrites
Jews tend to do well and people supposedly dislike this

Not if you draw the southern hemisphere at the top
So it seems they are stating that memes are okay, obviously that won't work on paper
I found this quite amazing place, where they sold bread rolls with fish and other stuff for very low price and it was delicious
Hope America and Canada are able to take the right measure to preempt these problems

I get why modern Germans and Austrians shun the Volksdeutch concept, but ping ponging Hitler between two nationalities seems like a waste of time
Now even Indians have forgotten about Pachisi and only Ludo is known
Same in Germany from my observation
What caused this economic crisis
Trump: I don't even know you
Because your war machine does good too, sometimes
This makes me realise why people didn't like the Eiffel Tower initially, it's a random steel tower in the middle of such a beautiful city
Because a lot are normal people trying to seek better lives
Aap se milke accha laga
What about Russia, playing as a part of the Russian Mafias
Wouldn't the Austrian government interfere ?
Surely that was sheer idiocy, not betrayal
No, more like Chiang Kai Shek's instead
PPS: Visiting just 5 cities does not do justice to another 50 beautiful cities in Europe such as: Barcelona, Nice, Marseilles, Brussels, Munich, Krakow, Zagreb, Berlin, Ljubljana, Salzburg, Vienna, Rotterdam, Oslo, Copenhagen
He told me that they used some Mexican sauce which gave that distinct taste
Any specific reason why Germany is left out
The goal was to bleed out the russians like they bled america in vietnam

Russia is portrayed as a grim and uninteresting place by the American media, but I was always fascinated by the country
Germans still like to explore around
Please correct me if I'm wrong
In India we bring in school bags containing books for that day
Listen, you piece of shit
mate , anything with gummies on it can never be inconveniently big , only inconveniently small
We have canesugar juice with added lemon drops and salt
God knows we need something like this in India right now
I think that depends on what you mean by Hellenic culture (I also think the term "Hellenistic" might be more appropriate)
Portuguese were the first of the colonies, introduced the printing press and missionaries etc coming via Goa (Vasco da Gama)
You can guess what happened next
I didn't mean East or West would be at the top

Ah shit, it's the beginning of the holidays in japan and I am drunk and sad now
The Romans were also keen learners who often encorporated the culture of their colonies, namely Greece, into their own culture, and that's how Hellenic culture emerged
I just looked up the entire list

This fucked up my brain
>"If one looks at the two centuries between the Second Punic War and the age of Cicero, the impression is of an enthusiastic borrowing of Greek artistic and intellectual skills, slowly leading to the emergence of a developed Latin culture; the central period of Hellenization of the Roman oligarchy was precisely the period when it was locked in escalating internal competition which finally destroyed the system
Ahh, I wonder what kind of houses get built there
can confirm
Is this true for Ireland as well
Only saying Iran now won't actually encapsulate the area which was earlier Persia
It Looks Goregous
This might spark rebellion in Russia

France used to have 30m back when England had 8m and the Holy Roman Empire had 20m. How and why the French stopped proliferating between the revolution and the second world war is pretty interesting, and a return to partible inheritance is probably the most easily described component

> I would vote for Macron, since he at least understands that the EU needs changes and I really hope he succeeds
I thought I'd mention Persia but it wasn't restricted to one particular defined region as of then, which is why i didn't. Otherwise yeah of course Persian influence with so many Sultanates especially in the north India
What else can be expected of a country full of bankers
Yes
