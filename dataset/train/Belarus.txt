If I had to name any country that does it, I'd say France, yes  C'est la greve, motafickers

Where is Belarus's third eye, which can shoot radioactive laser beams
Belarus is a livingroom of Russia

We're talking about a full-blown *hostile* takeover
A little bit different thing
well, that other thing that I'll skip in order to avoid a massive fight
Damn, those melons are enormous
Putin: so, we have a list of countries we don't like, how do we let the people know which countries they should hate
In Belarus similar rallies went on in every city
Kuril Islands, yeah, every other summer as a child
I'm more curious how mad are general Latvians when people read Latvija as Latveedza
He is ok, but I wouldn't say I like his videos

The Latin variant isn't official at all
This honestly sounds like you're justifying actual fascism
1500 riot police
Kids these days seem to actually pay attention during BelMova lessons, and the number of people writing in Belarusian online has increased by an order of magnitude during the last decade
Former Soviet republics which always were popularized in Soviet times as brothers, friends etc
Well we dont really have much of an identity but our president pushes for "welcoming and tolerant" to be a defining trait of belarusians and I'm fine with that
Yes, mods there are really pro-putin and no one knows why
There is no law in this country anymore
Who's gonna fight for Luka
They really didn't want to be anywhere near potential enemies, for obvious historical reasons
A lot of places still don't have that option, though activists annoying civil servants by demanding it (the law/constitution is always technically on activists' side in this) have gotten things to get somewhat better recently
Good riddance
I'd like to point out that the guy you replied to is a bit of a troll on r/Belarus and does not represent the majority's sentiment
It's a game to them, they like to play games with prisoners (those usually involve beatings, bone-breaking or even rape)
Journalists are supposed to be safe at those things, I'm pretty sure attacking them is illegal and a pr nightmare
How cool is that
Do you speak Brazilian
I love their facts:
Not us
It's basically a huge tire factory surrounded by commieblocks and private houses
I'd bring back our [historical one]
I remember my sweet old Nokia 5130 XpressMusic

I already addressed the whole danger thing, but I'll just add that quite a few people have illegally returned to their villages in the zone, on both sides of the border
Google has slightly bigger user base than Yandex, but yeah, it seems to be political reason
You can get used to it, obviously (most of us understand it perfectly) but it's certainly not immediately comprehensible without preparation
Please stop writing Belarusian with the double s! Where does this even come from
So who are the 14 Belarusian porn stars
Well, you have at least one person from Belarus
If I had to guess, it'd probably be Ukraine
Delightful, huh
The idea in Russian propaganda is to take those countries back, "reunite" as they say even against their will
In jail people were tortured
Yes would mean Parliament support, No - President support
"Zvezda" is not just a state-run TV station (and internet site), it's run by Russian Ministry of Defence

It is so fucking depressing, he is an absolute lunatic giving himself over 80% when he actually got 20 maximum
Plus - it's pointless anyway, as we can see by your capital nearly 30 years later
I wrote a big reply to bring some light
Pripyat (the actual location, named after a river that flows there) was built from the ground up for the power plant hence it didn't lend its name to the facility
It's like quoting snopes
I can't discuss any serious and deep things
They release all kinds of data, basically it's the people who collect the data being to lazy to learn Russian and read the sources firsthand
Set up Belarusian schools in small cities

That's why English makes me more nervous and unsure
But they have to do it in front of OMON (our brutal police, yup, those guys in helmets)

What about on per county level in Texas
nogoodnik must be from Russian niegodnik, which means no-good-enough and used for children who don't behave
This winter we had a lot of protests against union with Russia, and I don't think someone was arrested (at least I don't know about it)
So Belarus is somewhere between 30 and 1160 years old
I believe not serious as unification is impossible as for now
We have quite a lot:
Would be fun if Voat turned out to be an Interpol project to keep track on radical communities
At least not directly and there was a numler of succesfull autoritarian states (S. Korea, Singapore, somehow Argentina and Greece)
I'll probably sound dumb now but I need to ask about sz thing
Besides salary Russia is behind Belarus in  every other index, ecology, life longevity, corruption, criminal activity, etc
I'm not a government support, but see no reason in these silly renamings
This is an exaggeration, Belarus is nothing like North Korea
Ability to use the language in government services has gotten better in the last few years but it's still barely there
I've already seen it in cases of some Ukrainian zoomers, whose written Russian makes my eyes bleed

It was done kind of by accident, that's true

More than 30 000 people were arrested like this since the elections in August
They really didn't want to be anywhere near potential enemies, for obvious historical reasons
Pretty dire situation
You can literally get killed for nothing and no one will be held responsible
I remember when I was a kid a common excuse/joke was "my mother locked me in home".
I'd say either the BNR or _maybe_ the GDL would be the first major examples of a mostly belarusian state
And enough as they have OMON and police on their side
Not millions , just like a little bit more then million and a half
Applying this logic we can say that Russia is also independent state that was born after collapse of the USSR 30 years ago
But for sure belarusian kgb has me
English-speaking media coverage of Belarus is almost non-existent
No ammo
They mainly visit Western Belarus
Yup
You do know there's a space station in space right now that is filled with people, right
Asking for a friend
Yeah
And they do it all with smiles on their faces
Baltic countries, Georgia, now Ukraine and sometimes others too if needed
>In a conflict like the one he had with Trotsky, Stalin just simply appeared as the more likeable guy between the two

Right now they arrest people who hang white-red-white flags, wear white-red-white clothes, post critical comments on social media, journalists, Polish minority activists, sportsmen who supported protests, artists who wrote protest songs etc

Propaganda minister: I'm too tired today, man, fuck it, just publish the list as is
That always amazed me about you Southern Slavs
Also Belarusian became a hipster and opposition language: some people speak only Belarusian, they are mostly artists, actors etc or opposition of course, they are viewed as weirdos by general Luka's fan base :-/
It's ok, lyrics is quite neutral
Other are almost the same
In Belarus Pan Tadeusz is known, but it's not a core part of ideology (probably as it's in Polish)
I feel like everyone should come and see Belarus with their eyes and not judge it from their democratic sofa
We have very different mentality and goals
I have exactly the same trending words
In Russian the official name is Belarus, but
Dictatorship
So primitive, sorry
Belarusian is still East Slavic language, but with a lot of West Slavic vocabulary, very close to Ukrainian
If I had to name any country that does it, I'd say France, yes  C'est la greve, motafickers
Hungary made sense, both sides did things like that (see South Vietnam) but behaviour towards Czechoslovakia in relatively peaceful Brezhnev time was outright disgusting
Real elections
Otherwise Russia was only ever briefly ruled by "locals" between Mikhail and Peter
He is insane, absolutely off the rails
It's not healthy in this sense :)
The number of tanks Soviet Union lost during WW2: approximately 86
True, I just upset about all these naked woman who lays whole days on the sidewalks of my daily bike-road and doing nothing but sun baths
In my country many people still set the table right on the grave
Ex-president falsified elections that he lost by drawing 80% votes for himself
Anyone concerned already knows
Things like cancelling trains, making impossible for own people to get medical help looks insane from Belarus

Are you high on Russian propaganda
All the data is right here available in the web
Indeed, I'd strongly advise against it
Gypsies do nothing else than lie and steal, idk how people can defend them
It's an interesting historical bit of trivia
I dont even know how to respond but im interested why Serbian people dont want to join EU
Take them to another country
Full respect for rioters, but that title is a hell
There was and is a big discussion on which would be more correct: Belarus or Litva (not Lithuania)
They share a lot of vocabulary from Rech Pospolitaya times
That's true
Africa,
Finland already lost and switched over by that time, and your deal with USSR (including the border changes - mostly Pestamo) was pretty much set in stone
Obviously the USSR didn't abandon hopes for the world revolution eventually just because it recognised the legitimacy of capitalist governments in Europe
The only thing that kept me reluctant in moving back was that I had already became so accustomed to America and the fact my Russian is quite shit (I was taught Belarusian and English only)
It's not great or anything - the language is still basically non-existent in any capacity in city life, but it doesn't seem to be on its way to extinction anymore
Same in Belarus
Because I watch money heist at the moment
I prefer tea, but when I do have coffee, I generally prefer Cuban coffee
Let's see if your definitions of vile, racism, sexism and homophobia are the same as mine
Some would say the Principality of Polatsk or even the current Republic of Belarus
That's what I thought too
First of all, they toned down with violence after \~first month after elections
HL2 style was strongly based on eastern European totalitarian regimes, so it's not surprising really
That's what we need
That's peanuts, nothing like Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz or Dztschiztschiezschisch
How can it be civil war if Russian army potential involvement means foreign occupation, like the one currently going in Ukraine
Thanks Ukraine for being good friends
There's no way she got less than 70% as everyone I know voted for her, and I don't know a single person who voted for Lukashenko
Forgot one more thing: his quotes are epic, the guy is a stand up artist on his own
Happy cake day, neighbors

It's not just salary, but how the territory develops, I've seen many ruined houses in Pskov region, city itself not the worst, but villages are awful, State doesn't care about them at all

They're like us but just
Belarus had 2 referendums in 1990th
And we also never had protests like in Moscow 2019, because the country is smaller and because he is very popular among older people

Based on your comment you would see US
This honestly sounds like you're justifying actual fascism
Was actually planning on moving back to get a work permit just to get away from America for a bit, but considering how tensions have flaired up in Belarus too, I'm planning on staying put for now
However they don't do it for all artifacts because there is risk of transportation damage and security involved
Kind of killed any possibility of either treating the Warsaw Pact as an alliance of sovereign state and the Soviet high ground with regards to being the only Great Power willing to (and prevented from) help Czechoslovakia during Munich Conspiracy
to je true je to cringe jak neco
Was anything about Finland actually decided in Yalta
Yep, you guys are in the same situation, have your own beautiful language but speak the language of the country that you historically hated  and everyone feels that it's wrong but it's too late to change things
Dictatorship
120 for Belarus on the highways, 90 for the other roads outside cities, and 90/100 for MKAD beltway in Minsk
Doesn't mean it's not progress

Give me real numbers and what do you count as "killed by Stalin".  Do we count stupidity as killing (that c)
Except that it's not only possibility, it might as well turned into even worse with you posting same thing but with different name in it
Just in few years russian people became ok with killing and invading their "brothers" ukrainians just because they were told on TV and in newspapers that they're fascists
] Entire Polesyan region is a giant swampy forest, so it's not really guarded too well outside of the main access roads
When the Soviets occupied Latvia they were allied with Germany

* Urupinsk (real and not that small town in Russia; noone know why, probably due to unusual name)
Ukrainian has about as much divergent weirdness in it as Polish does - but it's different type of weirdness (instead of your constant "ższrz" it's "i" replacing half the vowels)
I bet standing next to this pile of trash and looking at the Church one can overdose on spirituality (dukhovnost') easily
Marseillaise and L'Internationale are as good as it gets as well
While most people do usually have a good knowledge of Belarusian and it is taught in schools, Russian is vastly more dominant and preferred, mainly because of the Kremlin's ruthless domination and manipulation of Lukashenka (although I'm hopeful that he works out a deal with the US and EU to become less controlled by Putin and his thugs)
That's the positive side of it not being really promoted officially, I guess
The amount of sun needed to produce enough amount of vitamin D is often overestimated by people
My last German lesson was two decades ago, so I might be an idiot that's about to embarrass himself - but it seems to me that I can pronounce it fairly easily
President had a huge public support and crisis was finished with President's victory, who got the power to dismiss the Parliament

Was expecting Belarus to be at 0, since porn production is illegal here
Yep, because, they'll fuck you up, turn you into a chopped meat just for defending yourselves
I don'r agree, renaming brings nothing
Dictatorship, BelAZ and potatoes

For the rest it was liberation
After that when people came out on the streets for peaceful protest riot police attacked people, killing 2 and detaining 7000
I honestly do like the Red and Green flag over the White Red White flag, that is the one thing Lukash did that I fully support
[Here you go]
Less, actually, considering the fact that Sweden was literally against the US in Vietnam
Where is Belarus's third eye, which can shoot radioactive laser beams
After our lands were attached to Russian Empire, in 1830s, they've banned word Litva/Lithuania as a name for lands that are mostly nowadays Belarus
A lot of places still don't have that option, though activists annoying civil servants by demanding it (the law/constitution is always technically on activists' side in this) have gotten things to get somewhat better recently
Like how FBI used to host kiddieporn sites to fish out pedos
She said
And that's where this word starts being widely accepted by people living there
Next group is Polish tourists
I don't remember exact mechanism, but by DNA damage I meant reversible damage of some bonds in the DNA, not the breaking of the thread
If you get caught, it wouldn't be a minor fine - it would be a serious criminal charge
USSR wanted it as a basing point for part of the Baltic Fleet, so the most logical recipient was Lithuanian SSR, whose leaders noped out for demographic reasons
No, he's all yours
Yup, that's my point, don't be afraid, come and see ️
But they can rig it up, yeah
The word itself came from Ekaterina - definitely true
Still a few protests from what I've heard from my friends
Tut
I live in Belarus and I am allowed to say what I want, we don't have Stasi or KGB agents behind everyone's back
"A mix of Russian and Polish", "Russian, but it's rotten by Polish" (mostly by Russians)
Only Moscow and SPb have bigger salary than Minsk, but quality of life is much better here, we don't have traffic jams, parks everywhere
I'm saying this being an opposition-supporter myself
A-a-and we are still landlocked
Fuck that
You probably win
Too many SFX, too much pathos
Anyway it is about right balance, no one wants melanoma
Autoritarism is not related to a quality of live
It actually got somewhat fashionable nowadays ;) since "edgy" kids will always go with something that's somewhat unconventional

Yes and no, I think we just stopped protesting against the government because duh
May be r/notinteresting
The is multiple human-rights protecting organizations covering the situation in Belarus
Toll roads
Definitely
Poland, Norway and Bosnia seemed to be the only ones who are normal
And noone will ask what are you doing
Was anything about Finland actually decided in Yalta
Yeah
Sadly, internet + opinion = downvotes
This kind of activity was perpetrated all over the world, NATO states included
It was caught lying many many times in last years, especially about Ukraine and conflict there
You're just looking for an issue where there isn't one
So Belarus is somewhere between 30 and 1160 years old
Did Latvian nationals had their own aviation during Barbarossa
That's why they allowed Russian company to shoot all the streets and post it in the internet with free access
Few days but now we have no but +3 outside instead of usual -12c - -23c
Will they shoot and kill 9 mln
if not more
Doesn't seem likely - it wasn't even tried in Finland, which was squarely outside of any NATO sphere of influence
Plus, like you said, guided tours are a major thing now, so regardless of what you do, you'll be dodging crowds of foreigners gaping at all the "touristy" locations, which kind of ruins the whole "abandoned" feeling as well
I see it in a lot of Hungarian words and was always curious about it :)
You better not
There's fucking two million of you Slovenes, and you still manage to have distinct dialects
If it's fully supported by population, ok, we can use it to please them, but usually people just make fun out of it

"We invented it" - that's not true

Plus - it's pointless anyway, as we can see by your capital nearly 30 years later
Sometimes its used in street signs instead of phonetic "English" style, but it confuses the fuck out of everyone but Poles who can read it
He is ok, but I wouldn't say I like his videos
What does white represent on the map
People say that my country and Finland don't exist
I hope not
Zajebiście
Attention of the international community is very important for us
Pskov was not in GDL, but they were under protectorate of GDL (Belarus) or in military treaty with us
I am an American citizen because my family became American citizens before I was born, but we still visit Belarus when we can
All people there belong to Caucasian race
Saying that Russians would be "running at the Germans unarmed" without Lend-Lease is at least ignorant
But you can

Yet they're still called dialects, not languages
You're almost correct
I hope not
Yandex Street view is available in Belarus
What does white represent on the map
And we have the 2nd worst passport right before Kosovo
Some, but not that many
And do you want a quick after election morning fact
Personally, I'd rather be in jail than a fascist
Belarus is exotic enough for them (because Belarus was strongly influenced by western culture), but also it's almost like home (because everything is in Russian and people have friendly attitude)
I'm speaking about it's documented way to Old Russian, not Bulgarian
This cities probably most Slavic (some might say the only) that Russia have
So true
Dictatorship puta madre
Like how FBI used to host kiddieporn sites to fish out pedos
For a regular trip, unless you plan to specifically lick the [Elephant's Foot] or search out and eat mushrooms from the most irradiated locations in the "ginger forest" - you'll be fine
Garbuz in Belarusian is a pumpkin
Belarus and Belarusians have 1000+ years plus history, rooting from Polatsk principality, that was founded almost 300 years before Moscow
Blessed
You've had almost half the country already speaking Ukrainian in 1991, and even your rather energetic promotion efforts have barely shifted the language border (see Kiev for example, as well as obviously east and south)
Some people died
Originally this name came from Ruthenia - a historical region in the East Europe
Sounds really weird if you don't know the context
Yes, street signs and other visible official stuff is now pretty much exclusively in Belarusian in public places but that really does fuck all for languages advancement - we could always *understand* it
Interesting
Propaganda is that strong
I sure do ️️
Why don’t you guys buy an a/c if you hate heat so much

By that logic, our anti-German sentiment should be through the roof
Use it with respect
yet you go 90 all the way from Moscow to the border with Belarus
So he made a decision to STOP protecting us and let special forces continue to establish a mass terror policy
They have to change it "Communism regimes are totalitarian". And still not all, but some of them
Many people state they are willing to do it
I'd bring back our [historical one]
If you asked me a decade ago, I'd be a lot more pessimistic
Kachka in Russian is a pitching
Not according to Lenin
All the data is right here available in the web
In any case, Poles were far too busy crying about the loss of Vilna, Lvov, and Grodno to mount a serious claim (through the fact that Ducal Prussia was a Polish vassal at one point)
And some other random people in the list who are even worse in a way
Russia hardly processed Crimea, economy is choking
I did warn that I might, in fact, be an idiot
But I'm telling you everyone wishes him the worst
Less, actually, considering the fact that Sweden was literally against the US in Vietnam
Forgot one more thing: his quotes are epic, the guy is a stand up artist on his own
At the same time GDL and GDM were rivals and often in war
So, the fact is that after this repaire there is some substance which causes cell to start producing melanin
You sentence contains a contradiction
The same as other renamed countries like Kyrgyzstan
Tell me
material supply as bigger contribution in contrast to the millions (more than 27
I know what the reasoning was at the time - the whole "slippery slope" thing with Tito's Yugoslavia used as an example of a socialist state slowly drifting towards the capitalist camp (though it was actually neutral)
Novgorod, Pskov and Tver wanted to join GDL and RP and were destroyed
Putin is not stupid, he won't invade another country, and get 10 mln
All your base are belong to us
U.S. deliveries to the U.S.S.R. consisted mostly of jeeps, trucks, tanks, aircraft, food
Fucking stereotypes
Can it be related to the fact Communist parties were banned during these democratic elections
all other european countries get hand drawn unique pics and belarus gets shafted with the regular girl and just a pic of protests
>You need a guide to enter the zone
Like they had in Russia or Ukraine
How cool is that
The number of tanks Soviet Union lost during WW2: approximately 86
Sounds really weird if you don't know the context
this is what you get in Poland for 8 €/month: [
It is also depressing because military and army are with him, not with people
Europe is weird like that
If it's fully supported by population, ok, we can use it to please them, but usually people just make fun out of it
You can easily get from Belarus to Russia
It was suppressed by the USSR, by the 80's, so many Russians came in to Russify Belarus, Belarusian became a language relagated to certain cities and the rural areas
I dont even know how to respond but im interested why Serbian people dont want to join EU
I remember seeing the map of Texas and all the economic hubs went blue in 2016 elections
of people who hate him and will fight against him
Chernobyl is a very ancient town in the region, and the closest already "existing" location to the power plant itself
hmm
Lukashenko definitely shows some finesse operating with Russia and cares about the country (through his perspective, but he does), fights corruption and oligarchy
She has no ambitions to become a president, she wanted to free all the imprisoned candidates, change the constitution from absolutele monarchy and slavery to a democratic one and resign, announcing democratic elections
[This one]
Ah, okay, I stand corrected
Yep
That's fair
I think we can 'compete' with Dukanovic's montenegro but definetely not with Orban
* Babruisk (real and not that small jewish town in Belarus; the meme is from famous 1920th writers Ilf and Petrov)
Wie hurensohn du hurensohn
Not enough people outside of Belarus fully realize how cruel and how mad our dictator has gone
What could be considered positive about that
In the 90s-00s the entire Pripyat city was *completely* stripped off of all the coloured metals and everything else that could possibly be sold
But *some* sort of Russian instruction, for the sake of basic literacy, is absolutely necessary
But this position its not a position its a mix of kind of stupidity and propaganda
From the post soviet point of view: we are have so much propaganda and head of Chechnya and fighter Habib Nurmagomedov criticize Macron for supporting those who shame the Muhhamad
Yes, he is very bad with technology overall, he bans internet - we use VPN, he blocks websites - we start new ones on international hosting
Or the reign of [Vseslav of Polotsk ] all the pagan myths and him being a werewolf
You forgot about lyustra: mirror in Belarusian, chandelier in Russian
Sovki will naturally die within next 20-30 years
Moskovites came there and killed many people
Latvia, for sure
Latvia is a very aggressive and dangerous neighbor
Dyvan in Belarusian is a carpet
Belarus is not even under jurisdiction of European Civilian Rights Court
Absolutely glorious
Doubt it
A ridiculous amount of people from outside the former USSR miss/skip the "white" part in their respective languages
But British anthem is played first when Hamilton wins
Novgorod Respublic was democracy by description close to Athens one, everyone could vote at veche, and muscovites hated this, they replaced it with slavery and everyone obey to the Tsar

Rewriting history is everywhere, Russians are victimized in media, "everyone is against us", "we have to resist", "God is with us" etc
It's obviously a sad loss of history and all but it's on the other side of the continent and I've only seen it twice
No love between Putin and Lukashenko though, they hate each other
Australia,
Not according to Lenin
Livingroom, you say
It's like many think that Belarus is a part of Russia  or Austr(al)ia and Swedentzerland thing
Ukrainian has about as much divergent weirdness in it as Polish does - but it's different type of weirdness (instead of your constant "ższrz" it's "i" replacing half the vowels)

Good riddance
??? is considered several thousands, the exact number is Lukashenko’s personal secret
It's getting slightly better, but *slowly*. The problem of my generation, which developed irrational hostility towards Belarusian due to having to learn everything in it for like two years in the early 90's (which seemed like a pointless complication at the time) is basically gone
We don't care how old is it
We can only regret that Belarussian autoritarism is based on elderly-based populism and has nothing to suggest except of "let it be as it is". But we can clearly see the same tendency in Europe and the USA
I'm still a little bit shocked that it wasn't even paid lip service to, considering how western allies viewed the danger of Germany after the war

Why did she hide her bike
The rebuilt old Town, or commi blocks, or a few glass skyscrapers
Of course you wouldn't get too emotional about a conference that doesn't affect you
There is no any even arested journalists in Belarus (as for now)
Seeing violent crackdowns like these literally everywhere in the world makes me think true democracy doesn't exist
"Communism is totalitarian by its nature" - it's not, communism is supposed to be stateless society without power concept, so a contradiction is totalitarianism

The only thing, more crimes does the militia against people, more motivation they would have to keep the dictator just to avoid being convicted themselves
Illegal border crossing in general is kind of frowned upon all over Europe
Let's get the facts straight
So I don't think they will do it against the will of 10 mln people
Belarus will never join Russia
Because Moskovia that further turned into Russian Empire occupied and destroyed Independent Pskovian Republic, then tried to erase memories connected with old times

In Belarusian sun is neutral or it, earth is feminine or she, moon is masculine or he
Race is wrong word here
They enjoy violence, they invent new fucked up ways to beat people up, their job is to break people physically and psychologically
Hello
It is the second scenario sadly, Belarusian had a great revival between 1991 and 1994 but then Lukashenko happened :( Belarusian is more spoken un rural areas where nobody speaks a clear language, it is a very weird mixture of Belarusian + a bit of Russian + something else (Polish or Ukrainian, depending on what side of the country you are at)
I think I know what you mean
I've been to both Pskov and Smolensk and can say they are much worse than our Viciebsk right across the border
This one is also primitive
If Hungary would happen - sure, bring in the Warsaw Pact troops but as it stood
It's goverment-sanctioned
Definitely not the worst in the world, to be honest
My favorites ️️️ Replaying DOS1 right now, what a joy
Measures of a much milder sort running for just a couple of years in the early 90s caused a backlash that was part of the reason for Lukashenko's rise, so getting anything anywhere near your level of government support is sci-fi in Belarus
EDIT
Till now I have a feeling it was one of the best cities in my life
There's absolutely nothing wrong with -ia thing
Picked up quite a few:
I've been to both Pskov and Smolensk and can say they are much worse than our Viciebsk right across the border
Do you think this warrants arrest

If you can speak and read Belarusian, you can pretty much understand like 75-80% of what a Ukrainian says or writes
Sure thing, the best product from Moldova
They have to change it "Communism regimes are totalitarian". And still not all, but some of them

First of all, there is A LOT of Russian tourists
Petersburg toll road with 130 km/h. So, in my opinion, the map should read 130
Maybe they did not have a chance, but it still makes the fact stupid
>This map is outdated somewhat
In Belarus it's right away 120 + 9
"A mix of Russian and Polish", "Russian, but it's rotten by Polish" (mostly by Russians)
I'm still a little bit shocked that it wasn't even paid lip service to, considering how western allies viewed the danger of Germany after the war
All in all the facts speak against your assumption
Those days "it was known as the "land of the Rus"/  Slavic: Rus' ,  *Rus'skaya zemlya* / Latin: Rus(s)ia  (with local German spelling variants *Ruscia* and *Ruzzia*) "

There were "Long live Belarus", "Leave", "Put Lukashenko into autozak" and the funny one "Time to change bald tires".
Perhaps Кино?
It's not just salary, but how the territory develops, I've seen many ruined houses in Pskov region, city itself not the worst, but villages are awful, State doesn't care about them at all
I'm sad, but it is how it is
You're right on the fucking money
The mood in the country is very bad at the moment, we are defeated
In small cities, though, that's just not an option at all (which is obviously wrong)
The report assesses only current situation, i.e. the amount of journalists in prison right now

Those disappearances you mentioned occurred mostly during 90'ties and the begging of 00'ties, ~~when here still was an opposition movement threatening the regime~~.
It would fall way sooner without this support, maybe in 1994 even
This is an exaggeration, Belarus is nothing like North Korea
You don't need to be 6 hours a day under the direct sunlight to get right amount of this vitamin
Obviously the USSR didn't abandon hopes for the world revolution eventually just because it recognised the legitimacy of capitalist governments in Europe
if not more
And people don't really care that Big Brother is watching us, we say what we want online ️
One of the main ways to do that is to drain their money pool, which is already working btw due to strikes, boycotting government services and goods and most of all, by how much they spend on continuing the war on people
Why would you be *pleasantly* surprised by that
000 tanks
So, people in cars are not people
It's a very weird situation
Belarusian is still East Slavic language, but with a lot of West Slavic vocabulary, very close to Ukrainian
While around these parts it's **really** impossible to tell if a person is from Minsk, Kiev, or 12 time zones and a world biggest country away in Vladivostok
Cause Poland wasn't part of the USSR and thus wasn't offered it

He can take Luka as prisoner and ass rape him daily, I will sign off necessary papers
Bring Russain army, whatever, nobody will work and they not gonna fight that army
After our lands were attached to Russian Empire, in 1830s, they've banned word Litva/Lithuania as a name for lands that are mostly nowadays Belarus

Thanks Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia for being nicer to us than the rest of the EU
I'm more curious how mad are general Latvians when people read Latvija as Latveedza
the thing is, it'd be Byelorussia, and no one still spells either variant correctly
It's like quoting snopes
Belarus is a livingroom of Russia
At the same time GDL and GDM were rivals and often in war
You could also get there from the Belorussian side of the border, but I wouldn't recommend it

No at all
If we talk about possible violent scenarios, sieging govt buildings is too dangerous at this stage, but many people talk about partizan war where they find people from OMON (the special division of police which did all tortures and killings across the country) and beating them up, putting their cars on flames or killing them
1)  Kievan *Rus*. ;)
However they don't do it for all artifacts because there is risk of transportation damage and security involved
Not enough people outside of Belarus fully realize how cruel and how mad our dictator has gone

This winter we had a lot of protests against union with Russia, and I don't think someone was arrested (at least I don't know about it)
What about on per county level in Texas
While around these parts it's **really** impossible to tell if a person is from Minsk, Kiev, or 12 time zones and a world biggest country away in Vladivostok

Are you really sure about the meaning
In 1990, when the countery was officially renamed from Byelorussia (which is in fact slightly changed White Russia) to Belarus, we [our government, it's really not common here to associate government with people since, you know, look at the topic of a thread] started linguistical reforms, but these weren't finished
It was and the the war was even started by Belarusian airborne forces
People use wikipedia as their bible
Also, you guys kind of missed the whole 19th century European population explosion (when everyone else doubled or even tripled their populations), somehow
People don't want it
He sees the greatest threat in Telegram - people still use it smoothly
Victor Babariko will win
Asking for a friend
How did they shit and piss in space
Sure, we have an unregistered civil rights organization "Vyasna" ("Spring") who take care of this
It could be Swiss-neurtal only if it would have  the same size, the same natural borders, the same position on the map e.t.c.
It's funny how people here think that the Russians are fighting against the regime, while most Russians are still supporting Putin and hate opposition
And report to whom
U.S. deliveries to the U.S.S.R. consisted mostly of jeeps, trucks, tanks, aircraft, food
Only few "sovki" who remember USSR times, when they were young pity of USSR break up
Even from neighbouring place that should definitely know better than that
nogoodnik must be from Russian niegodnik, which means no-good-enough and used for children who don't behave
But I'm telling you everyone wishes him the worst
If Hungary would happen - sure, bring in the Warsaw Pact troops but as it stood

BLM became huge because of George Floyd's death, but here our local police has been using the same knee over neck thing all the time
Good luck, sending my energy from Belarus
It is the first time in my 30+ years existence when I don't want to live in my country, but there's no place to go as noone needs another immigrant from fucking Belarus
But ODKB says about military help only in case of foreign invasion, there's no invasion at all, just peaceful protest

The same happens in any country with enought space
The government wasnt rich in the first place, there is a financial crisis going on which led to Lukashenka's loss on the elections
it's 120in Belarus not 110
They are literally flooding cities like Hrodna
We are "independent" under management of Red Moscow
Europe is weird like that
There are tons of video where peaceful people including children are beaten and injured
But yes, we seem to have been the target of culture conversion/eradication machines from almost all of our neighbours, and now our own government
We have some places that provide documentation in Belarusian, while others don't. There was an example a few years ago where someone demanded to receive a military draft notice in Belarusian (since it's one of the official languages and thus he had a constitutional right to do so) and the "Belarusian" he received was laughable "trasianka" (equivalent of your "surzhyk") full of ridiculous mistakes
> let's not pretend these white-red flags are not inherently anti-Russian
Democracy is not something expected when there is nodoby who can lead the protests movement and meanwhile have a publick support
Except that there wasn't even a mumble about any sort of things like that in Czechoslovakia, and it's not like there was no way to let the events play out before deciding to crush it
You have Sochi and
You can also add dots on places of capitals :)
We have very different mentality and goals
Feels nice after several years of dry summer
We only have unlocked cabinets (?) for primary school pupils, but not in all schools
Applying this logic we can say that Russia is also independent state that was born after collapse of the USSR 30 years ago
Just shhh
Was actually planning on moving back to get a work permit just to get away from America for a bit, but considering how tensions have flaired up in Belarus too, I'm planning on staying put for now
I am saying it’s not such an easy decision
Salary is not everything
It's a **pshik**alka is Russian
She has no ambitions to become a president, she wanted to free all the imprisoned candidates, change the constitution from absolutele monarchy and slavery to a democratic one and resign, announcing democratic elections
I've seen once some guy from Bryansk speaking on TV, he sounded like typical Belarusian
Russia’s list of unfriendly countries: Weishnoria, Wakanda, Osman Empire, Mongolian Empire, Bionicles, Democratic party of USA, Ice-cream sellers
And noone will ask what are you doing
I actually find the Soviet behaviour towards Czechoslovakia to be the primary taint on the overall Soviet post-war European record
UK at least fit into the picture
The new bloodborne 2 graphics are stunning
Nah, this was all because of Polish plumbers
Cause at one hand we have image and in another we have kill

Actually, these are the numbers from the last time I bothered to check
We currently basically make no movies, music, or TV series in our native language

Petersburg toll road with 130 km/h. So, in my opinion, the map should read 130
Oh, and I guess Russia exists too, thanks for cheap gas and and not invading us (yet)

If you have an alternative I'd love to hear it
Because Free Novgorod together with Pskov and Tver was part of what used to be original Rus, together with Polotsk (Belarus), Kyiv (Ukraine) who were resisting Mongol-Tatars, and Moscovites were occupied by Golden Horde and accepted many of their traditions, such as cruelty
A large part of the nation thinks "I better stay away from this and will be safe".
I remember seeing the map of Texas and all the economic hubs went blue in 2016 elections
Otherwise Poland have to commemorate Sanacja victims as well
1 стол, 2 стол**а**, 5 стол**ов**.

Lukashenko definitely shows some finesse operating with Russia and cares about the country (through his perspective, but he does), fights corruption and oligarchy

Fucked over the Belarusian language and made the country seem like a Russian puppet, literally the most embarrassing thing Belarus has ever done
Belarus is not even under jurisdiction of European Civilian Rights Court
Grown up questioning things, but hey 2 holidays is 2 holidays, I ain't complaining ヽ(ヅ)ノ
Yup
Thanks Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia for being nicer to us than the rest of the EU
The word itself came from Ekaterina - definitely true
We had a classical Parliament crisis those days
It was suppressed by the USSR, by the 80's, so many Russians came in to Russify Belarus, Belarusian became a language relagated to certain cities and the rural areas
are now enemies, american puppets, fascists etc
it's Russian for Belarus
The adjective Belarusian in Russian language goes from the word Byelorussia
Mass media tend to portray her as an Iron Lady of sorts
Yes, I do wear old clothes at home
1 стол, 2 стол**а**, 5 стол**ов**.
How is Belarusian national flag Anti-Russian
There are parts of Minsk where this is still sort of true
Lithuania was offered it after the war, but they declined due to barely having enough Lithuanians to populate Vilna
Who's gonna fight for Luka
That would be re-occupation, occupation of already occupied land
Cause Poland wasn't part of the USSR and thus wasn't offered it
So he made a decision to STOP protecting us and let special forces continue to establish a mass terror policy
The picture only represents our fascist government, not people
The amount of sun needed to produce enough amount of vitamin D is often overestimated by people
Belarus is exotic enough for them (because Belarus was strongly influenced by western culture), but also it's almost like home (because everything is in Russian and people have friendly attitude)
Jokes on you, Russian never cared about their soldiers
While hatred towards USA was always present they expanded it to Europe and closest allies
"фогот", not the "форгот" :)
But they weren't really offered, it was going to go to somebody in USSR for military reasons
The Eastern Bloc disintegrated together with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989–1991
Lol no
Only thing more stupid is to think that he is any more safe outside of Russia
The country was renamed and the expectation is that other countries will accept a new name variant
I'm all for learning Belarusian or any other national language but it would be quite retarded to forget Russian while we're at it
Just how Latin ain't English but just because you can read Latin/Cyrillic doesn't mean you can understand all languages using said alphabet
Attention of the international community is very important for us
All people there belong to Caucasian race
It's better guarded on one hand, and you'd be illegally crossing the border on the other
Also, you guys kind of missed the whole 19th century European population explosion (when everyone else doubled or even tripled their populations), somehow
He's not entirely wrong
In any case, Russian is still dominant in the government and education
And also, Byelorussia/Belarus circlejerk is a huge local meme, so it was very funny to see such a reaction here, on Reddit
The Latin variant isn't official at all
Kachka in Belarusian is a duck
End game now is to achieve the point of turbulence where Lukashenka's elites will realize that there is no future for them while he is in charge
But I assume fancy people have only nice clothes and where nice PJs at home
Still many Belarusians live in Pskov, Smolensk and Bryansk areas
I start feeling that we're protesting in vain
There is a handful of places in Belarus that don't take cards, even in tiniest towns or villages
I have exactly the same trending words
Please remember that
The same in Belarus
Chernobyl is a very ancient town in the region, and the closest already "existing" location to the power plant itself
To sum up: not so many people visit Belarus if you don't count Russians (for them it's top 1 country to visit on holiday)
I still don't get the logic of that action
I guess
If we want to be wealthy and develop we must move away from Russia, before it attacks us like you did attack Ukraine
No ammo
Pripyat (the actual location, named after a river that flows there) was built from the ground up for the power plant hence it didn't lend its name to the facility
That's why they allowed Russian company to shoot all the streets and post it in the internet with free access
And we say roof
Though, of course, getting spoken response in Belarusian is still basically impossible
Because Free Novgorod together with Pskov and Tver was part of what used to be original Rus, together with Polotsk (Belarus), Kyiv (Ukraine) who were resisting Mongol-Tatars, and Moscovites were occupied by Golden Horde and accepted many of their traditions, such as cruelty
Do you pronounce it as separate S and Z, or just S, or a mix between two

Once BRG was created, the whole "split" thing was pretty much guaranteed and once NATO came into being - even the remotest possibility of united Germany fell by the wayside, until one of the Cold War sides fully Finlandised to the other one
No weapons
Do we also get the nukes along with the flag
Thankfully it's starting to reverse a little bit, not as much as I'd like, but is progress in baby steps
Dubček wasn't a pro-NATO capitalist, nor did any of his reforms radically change the overall system in the country - it wasn't fucking perestroika or anything

Don't know how such processes went in other languages, but it is quite fair that while we haven't fully changed our name in country's official language, we will see these /nightmares from the past/.
If you try to build something new, build this new and then rename, if you start with renaming you will get the same shit
Ukrainians immigrate to Poland for better work while Poles immigrate to UK while the Irish resettled to the US
Sounds like a racism for me
I've already seen it in cases of some Ukrainian zoomers, whose written Russian makes my eyes bleed
Belarus and Belarusians have 1000+ years plus history, rooting from Polatsk principality, that was founded almost 300 years before Moscow
Maybe I'm ignorant, but I feel like nowadays it's a different story than in 2006 and 2010
Yep, because, they'll fuck you up, turn you into a chopped meat just for defending yourselves

Oh, and I guess Russia exists too, thanks for cheap gas and and not invading us (yet)
So you say that you can't get tanned skin from X-ray radiation

The only effective solution that I see is a nationwide strike, but it will not happen yet since a lot of people are not concerned with what's going on
I just happened to use a word that's common to both our languages but if I used an exclusively Russian word then yes you'd need to be a Russian reader and not a Cyrillic one
Like between Russian and Ukrainian, Polish and Czech
So primitive, sorry
Only Moscow and SPb have bigger salary than Minsk, but quality of life is much better here, we don't have traffic jams, parks everywhere
Yes, street signs and other visible official stuff is now pretty much exclusively in Belarusian in public places but that really does fuck all for languages advancement - we could always *understand* it
Belarus is not really bilingual, everyone speaks Russian or a crazy mixture of both, but Belarusian is taught in schools, represented in media, signs on the streets and transportation announcements are strictly in Belarusian

The government wasnt rich in the first place, there is a financial crisis going on which led to Lukashenka's loss on the elections
It can be fixed by cell itself and it does it all the time
I'd say that while Belarus is _technically_ bilingual, most people use Russian for most situations unless you're talking to people like rural Belarusians, the opposition, or the intellectual elite

From the post soviet point of view: we are have so much propaganda and head of Chechnya and fighter Habib Nurmagomedov criticize Macron for supporting those who shame the Muhhamad
Nothing to boast about, just 1991- jesus christ i'm scared of mr
But yes, we seem to have been the target of culture conversion/eradication machines from almost all of our neighbours, and now our own government
Naw, Russia has a huge "support group" in ex-USSR too, same as with Scandinavia
Judging by downvotes, negative
Do we count convicted as killed
You've had almost half the country already speaking Ukrainian in 1991, and even your rather energetic promotion efforts have barely shifted the language border (see Kiev for example, as well as obviously east and south)
And who is the next
Genocide
Country
But more and more people find out how to overcome internet blocking and can go to street, because our vote is nothing for government
Communist parties did not come to power as a result of the democratic process nor did they succeed in retaining power when democracy was restored
Do you pronounce it as separate S and Z, or just S, or a mix between two
And its if it's not there, it's not true
While the aid from U.S.A. to the U.S.S.R. was substantial, it was by far not the deciding factor (e.g. contribution) to the defeat of Germany
There's no way she got less than 70% as everyone I know voted for her, and I don't know a single person who voted for Lukashenko
Museums do rotate artifacts
I remember my sweet old Nokia 5130 XpressMusic

I think Polotsk because its oldest city in my country and i he has more interesting history
Sovki will naturally die within next 20-30 years
It's like many think that Belarus is a part of Russia  or Austr(al)ia and Swedentzerland thing
We're next
Somthing like that
I teally feel sorry for nordics and Paris ://

Doesn't mean that I just replace it with "z" :)
Why would you be *pleasantly* surprised by that
When the Soviets occupied Latvia they were allied with Germany
Map is wrong
Doesn't seem likely - it wasn't even tried in Finland, which was squarely outside of any NATO sphere of influence
Belarusians use to live in slavery
I'll probably sound dumb now but I need to ask about sz thing
South America,
(And then we will count how many people was killed and robbed by this "poor innocent noncriminals" after they were realised in 1953 after Stalin's death)
The Grand Duchy of Lithuania definitely,  with Vytautas being team assassins and Teutonic Order being team templars
It was done kind of by accident, that's true
No, I cannot
Good luck, sending my energy from Belarus

Doesn't mean that I just replace it with "z" :)
Please stop writing Belarusian with the double s! Where does this even come from
That's basically impossible
UK at least fit into the picture
It's an interesting historical bit of trivia
I can't discuss any serious and deep things
I was embarrased by Belarus for a bit, then I saw the other countries
Germans too aren't big on making territorial claims nowadays
4) Du bist krank am Kopf
Thank you ️ Poland will be my top choice to move, it is everything I want Belarus to be, it is impossible to turn Belarus into let's say France, people's mentality is too different, but it is very easy to follow Poland's way
Damn, that's a godly shot right there
Tanned skin is literally reaction of the body on DNA damage by UV light
Perhaps not as cruel as they did with Novgorod, but still, not much is left nowadays
I was basing my answer on what google pronounced it as - that seemed very doable
That's what I thought too
What about Belarus
Because Romanians don't speak Russian and Dan Balan sure does, so I knew it's Moldovan as soon he dropped the first song in Russian haha
Protestants, who only demand honest elections, are brutally beaten, gas and rubber bullets are used on them AND they will be sentenced to prison for it
In the cities it is Russian only, though almost everyone is able to speak Belarusian
It's goverment-sanctioned
Fun fact: the same do new Belarusian Rubles, the idea and style in general is borrowed from Euro
By that logic Bach was born in Thuringia, not Germany, Dante is Florentine, not Italian, and generally a shit tonne of pre-modern Europeans are foreigners to everyone but their immediate surroundings
North America,
The way I see it is that we need to do a few things in order to start shifting the situation a little bit:

I didn't expect that it's so calm and reasonable
So I'm not surprised at all
He is insane, absolutely off the rails
All you need is to get to Kiev, then take some private transport to the edge of the "zone". After that it's just a day's walk through the forest
After that it went to the "default" republic - RSFSR
B) you can take them with you
This word has literally never caused problems for me, even when my accent was atrocious - why the hell can't you guys pronounce it
There are HUNDREDS of thousands, not 10000
But this fucking lunatic will reign until his death and will be buried with blue fingers holding his throne
Lukashenko won’t step down himself — we only hope he will be “helped”.
It would fall way sooner without this support, maybe in 1994 even
Damn, that's a godly shot right there
In Belarus similar rallies went on in every city
Pskov
I hope
Originally this name came from Ruthenia - a historical region in the East Europe
to use your table example:
While hatred towards USA was always present they expanded it to Europe and closest allies
But more and more people find out how to overcome internet blocking and can go to street, because our vote is nothing for government
You're just looking for an issue where there isn't one
Sure, we have an unregistered civil rights organization "Vyasna" ("Spring") who take care of this
Latvia, for sure
His son Kolya is illegitimate son
I think USSR would probably just be content with having a buffer further down from it than it already was (as was the case with Austria and Sweden)
but how about 10-15 years in jail for disobedience
When in 1996 our parliament wanted to impeach Luka, reps of Russian parliament showed up and helped Luka
So true
>Now you say Oachkatzlschwoaf (squirrels tail in Bavarian)
The same as other renamed countries like Kyrgyzstan
Thank you ️ Poland will be my top choice to move, it is everything I want Belarus to be, it is impossible to turn Belarus into let's say France, people's mentality is too different, but it is very easy to follow Poland's way
Good luck
Putin sponsors Luka dictatorship, without his help, we would get rid of this mofo long time ago
De rien  that is one of my goals coming to this public, I am not a KGB agent, just a woman bored at home haha
And EU say: Shiiit
(Controversial opinion) Allowing the 1995 Belarusian referendum to give official status to the Russian language

If yes, I'm ok with this
People don't want it
People say that my country and Finland don't exist
Because I can't remember anything of the sort
The question is what is understood under "contribution" in the poll question
Till now I have a feeling it was one of the best cities in my life
Many families have relatives in Ukraine and they
We will hold even the military parade
Yes, you're correct
It's occasionally done on some street signs nowadays, but it just confuses the shit out of everyone outside of Grodno (where knowledge of Polish is at least somewhat decent)
While most people do usually have a good knowledge of Belarusian and it is taught in schools, Russian is vastly more dominant and preferred, mainly because of the Kremlin's ruthless domination and manipulation of Lukashenka (although I'm hopeful that he works out a deal with the US and EU to become less controlled by Putin and his thugs)
Yup, we do
As much as I dislike Lukashenko, I can appreciate that he's trying to make the Belarusian populous Belarusian and not "BelaRussian"
Belarus data worse then Russian
Here - not at all (in North Korea terms)
There is no any even arested journalists in Belarus (as for now)
There's absolutely nothing wrong with -ia thing
Just buy pass ticket for a month with a cash
What a lazy ones, why aren't they working
The Grand Duchy of Lithuania definitely,  with Vytautas being team assassins and Teutonic Order being team templars
That word came to Russian from Polish, changing its original meaning from God to sir
6 continents:
That's what we need
Most of Belarus is fairly evenly populated
A fairly large number of them is still alive (these were mostly very old people, unable to get used to life in the city), so all that the radiation background there does nowadays is make it more likely that one will develop various cancers and things like that - over the course of decades
You're almost correct
I used to go to
Thank you, I'd love to move, I've never though about it but I can't tolerate this anymore
The new bloodborne 2 graphics are stunning
Pls someone remake it with minsk and huge crowd of protestors with rwr flags in the background
This agreement is obsolete and to say "signed his country away with that move" is mistake
Dictatorship puta madre
That's not what people want or not want, it's how the politics works in places where there is not political live
That always amazed me about you Southern Slavs
Russia should've left them to Belarus, it would be better for people's wellbeing
He can take Luka as prisoner and ass rape him daily, I will sign off necessary papers
I bet this place is flooded by tourists
Say "squirrel" ;)))))
Worldwide, only English fully accepted the reform
Fuck em
Lifts have auto-closing doors, so you don't need to close it
Fun fact: the same do new Belarusian Rubles, the idea and style in general is borrowed from Euro
Toll roads
Here - not at all (in North Korea terms)
Why is it so bad in Italy
Still many Belarusians live in Pskov, Smolensk and Bryansk areas
We are literally the only real dictatorship in Europe
That's different
All Ukraine went to EuroMaidan in Kyiv
Ukrainians immigrate to Poland for better work while Poles immigrate to UK while the Irish resettled to the US
Britain proved in WW1 and WW2 that they don't need Europe
I think we can 'compete' with Dukanovic's montenegro but definetely not with Orban
I'm sure if we didn't make this huge mistake in 1994 we would be very alike at the moment
This one is also primitive
They release all kinds of data, basically it's the people who collect the data being to lazy to learn Russian and read the sources firsthand
It looks the same way from Belarus
What if the country doesn't have any people here
He might not be the best one, but Caligula is fascinating to me
It is the second scenario sadly, Belarusian had a great revival between 1991 and 1994 but then Lukashenko happened :( Belarusian is more spoken un rural areas where nobody speaks a clear language, it is a very weird mixture of Belarusian + a bit of Russian + something else (Polish or Ukrainian, depending on what side of the country you are at)
I honestly do like the Red and Green flag over the White Red White flag, that is the one thing Lukash did that I fully support
Why don’t you guys buy an a/c if you hate heat so much
No at all
You forgot about lyustra: mirror in Belarusian, chandelier in Russian
Somehow it’s very German
He had some pretty damaging words to say about both in his "last will".
Nah, this was all because of Polish plumbers
This is a list "the flavor of the month". There is not even Japan here who, one moment, is officially at war with Russia
Skotina in Russian

That's because you have your own excellent set of rules that every literate person in your country understands at least partially (though rarely entirely, since you need to know Belarussian to know when to write rz/sz/ż or h/ch and such things - Belarussian р/ш/ж and г/х respectively)
Still a few protests from what I've heard from my friends
Another great day even though it didn't feel like a fest anymore

I know what the reasoning was at the time - the whole "slippery slope" thing with Tito's Yugoslavia used as an example of a socialist state slowly drifting towards the capitalist camp (though it was actually neutral)
5 times before the 21st century)
Dubček wasn't a pro-NATO capitalist, nor did any of his reforms radically change the overall system in the country - it wasn't fucking perestroika or anything
Everyone is moving west, you just wait untill you get your own migrants from Russia
A fairly large number of them is still alive (these were mostly very old people, unable to get used to life in the city), so all that the radiation background there does nowadays is make it more likely that one will develop various cancers and things like that - over the course of decades
We aren't Ukrainians, we can't fight violence with violence
The only thing that kept me reluctant in moving back was that I had already became so accustomed to America and the fact my Russian is quite shit (I was taught Belarusian and English only)
They are pretty much the Gestapo of modern Belarus
**FACT 3**
They are literally flooding cities like Hrodna
One of them had a question "Do you agree that all state expenses should be transparent and be a part of the national budget". Most people (about 65%) answered NO
Given that a woman from the Netherlands was apparently injured here yesterday it is very sad to hear
Perhaps not as cruel as they did with Novgorod, but still, not much is left nowadays
No weapons
I wasn't there alot but i think it's possible
Progress doesn't always align with the predictions of the future
They mainly visit Western Belarus
There isn't as many Polish tourists as Russian
Are you really sure about the meaning
> What do you think what happens when free elections happen
Arbuz in Russian is a watermelon
Doesn't mean it's not progress
Hello
Well, Poland after WW1 did exactly that
It's not healthy in this sense :)
I like her, she is a brave woman who stood strong for her husband (who was an original candidate but was imprisoned before he could submit his documents)

Lohoshenko was always a huge fan of Hitler
What's a problem
I'm surprised we're not last
Also, Belarus should have been labelled "Byelorussia" - it's one hell of a trigger for us
Neither side wanted to give "their" piece of Germany up and the Western side wanted to use German manpower to sort of even out the massive conventional weapon disadvantage it was suffering from
Sure, there are a few normal people there, but they're probably all gone by now
\[They are\] the masters here
Well I never said Russians invented Cyrillic and I was thinking in Russian, not an alphabet
It reminds me Rhine IV photo

5) Ta gueule
Don't be too hard on you, that's just the reflection of Belarus in western media
OK, I think this lady was arrested because she held a camera and was shooting the scene how Konstatin Prydybailo, a Russian-related, pro-Lukashenko journalist takes an interview from the famous protester old lady
What could be considered positive about that
It's a very weird situation
Nothing to boast about, just 1991- jesus christ i'm scared of mr
It may be small but it still includes a few different cultures
My last German lesson was two decades ago, so I might be an idiot that's about to embarrass himself - but it seems to me that I can pronounce it fairly easily
He is not even hiding it at this point
This cities probably most Slavic (some might say the only) that Russia have
Yeah, the puppet state in the sense that Russia supports this regime economically and politically
So I'm not surprised at all
I spent a week of my honeymoon in Brno

That word came to Russian from Polish, changing its original meaning from God to sir

Good luck
Ukraine didn't exist until 1991, so it's kinda other way around
Ayy lmao does this mean we still have the dankest memes

First of all, there is A LOT of Russian tourists
Thankfully it's starting to reverse a little bit, not as much as I'd like, but is progress in baby steps

Feels nice after several years of dry summer

The arrest you saw on the back is done by police and the arrested person will be judged by a court, however the court decision will not be lawful, but completely political
Right now lukashenka's regime is an existential threat to anyone who lives in the country
Welcome to North Korea
We really need some Perun representation  in the series
Absolutely not surpising
LGBT propaganda
I guess
People use wikipedia as their bible
Trus in Belarusian is a rabbit
How do you not break the tongue
Not THAT few
How do you not break the tongue
And we also never had protests like in Moscow 2019, because the country is smaller and because he is very popular among older people
Moskovites came there and killed many people
And we learn this case as an exception in school
It's funny how people here think that the Russians are fighting against the regime, while most Russians are still supporting Putin and hate opposition
Hope this helped :)
If someone will die noone in the world would care because it's Belarus

I want to thank Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine for just being good friends to the Belarusian people
I was just tracing the probable route
A gift from the Belarusians
Dafuq
I agree with you
If we want to be wealthy and develop we must move away from Russia, before it attacks us like you did attack Ukraine
Fucking stereotypes
Yeah, there's definitely some movement in a positive direction, but Belarusian is still has kind of in a second-rate status around here
Google has slightly bigger user base than Yandex, but yeah, it seems to be political reason
Oh shit, this isn't funny anymore
One of them had a question "Do you agree that all state expenses should be transparent and be a part of the national budget". Most people (about 65%) answered NO
It's basically an official media of Russian military

I think it's generally a thing with romantic revolutionaries
We will hold even the military parade

True version of this meme: All european countries felled exept Britain
Can't see a difference in dark colors at the right pic, Russia is >6, right
Or the reign of [Vseslav of Polotsk ] all the pagan myths and him being a werewolf
So there is alot of reasons why you move out from Belarus
At this point I'm really don't care anymore
Are you high on Russian propaganda
Fucked over the Belarusian language and made the country seem like a Russian puppet, literally the most embarrassing thing Belarus has ever done
Do u know how dumb you are
Many people state they are willing to do it
It starts with "We Belarusian are peacefull people".
Maybe I'm ignorant, but I feel like nowadays it's a different story than in 2006 and 2010
At least not directly and there was a numler of succesfull autoritarian states (S. Korea, Singapore, somehow Argentina and Greece)
Progress doesn't always align with the predictions of the future
It looks like there's no difference between russian and belarusian, but it's fundamental

Thanks Ukraine for being good friends
A little bit different thing
No, we not trusting "democratic Putin", he's BFF with our own idiot Luka
It's obviously a sad loss of history and all but it's on the other side of the continent and I've only seen it twice
Other tourists are very very rare
It's A LOT of people, but you don't need to lie and exaggerate it
Russia is so authoritarian that this topic is banned even in r/russia
It's basically an official media of Russian military
Stalin is not fcking saint, but I hate lies and exaggeration
The line is blurry
I'm preparing to get out of here, seeing what is happening here right now is unbearable
Actually one person did die yesterday
Definitely
The "squirrel" thing seems universal among German speakers, not just the ones that are "new" to English, though
And do you want a quick after election morning fact
I am an American citizen because my family became American citizens before I was born, but we still visit Belarus when we can
Often smaller (райцентр) cities don't have any of those at all
To compare the contribution both ways: [$11 billion] from U.S.A. against $8 billion to U.S.A.
First line of our anthem says literally "We, Belarusians, peaceful people"
It's one of the problems
Nah, Lost Ivans don't want to get lost again
After that when people came out on the streets for peaceful protest riot police attacked people, killing 2 and detaining 7000
Map is wrong
What's wrong with proper English
No, the back (factories) is 30th, the middle (afterwar) is 50th, the front is modern day
I love their facts:
They are damn expensive, but their quality is shit
I was basing my answer on what google pronounced it as - that seemed very doable
Jokes on you, Russian never cared about their soldiers
In Russian it is the same, but moon as a whole moon is feminine but a crescent is masculine
Personally, I'd rather be in jail than a fascist
So Hitler was also a Slav
First of all, they toned down with violence after \~first month after elections
Well, Poland after WW1 did exactly that
While the aid from U.S.A. to the U.S.S.R. was substantial, it was by far not the deciding factor (e.g. contribution) to the defeat of Germany
Let these stupid people be
All your base are belong to us
A ridiculous amount of people from outside the former USSR miss/skip the "white" part in their respective languages
Actually any spray or deodorant can be called like that
Thank you for spreading the word, Reddit
Kids these days seem to actually pay attention during BelMova lessons, and the number of people writing in Belarusian online has increased by an order of magnitude during the last decade
Venice, Prague, Tromsø, Minsk, and Helsinki are the ones I recommend most (especially Minsk and Tromsø)
There were "Long live Belarus", "Leave", "Put Lukashenko into autozak" and the funny one "Time to change bald tires".

Basically, they arrest whoever comes to their mind/happens to be near them

We need support badly
Thanks Russia for not invading us (yet)
This will be very tough term for him and US
You do know there's a space station in space right now that is filled with people, right
And its if it's not there, it's not true
The only thing, more crimes does the militia against people, more motivation they would have to keep the dictator just to avoid being convicted themselves
of people who hate him and will fight against him
People in Western Europe don't like to be reminded of the fact that the USSR actually offered to create a united Germany to their ex-allies - under the condition of it being neutral, at least Austria-style (though preferably Switzerland)

What architecture
He's not entirely wrong
It isn't, though
If you really intersted, you'll find something
And our president is in charge for 26 years
1500 riot police
But they can rig it up, yeah
That's peanuts, nothing like Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz or Dztschiztschiezschisch
Ukraine didn't exist until 1991, so it's kinda other way around
No, but they had the most casualties per capita in both of these conflicts
What
Totalitarian in case of Poland
This shitbag demanded recalculation of the votes on every protocol, where he lost aka the numbers were real
No, I cannot
I'd say that while Belarus is _technically_ bilingual, most people use Russian for most situations unless you're talking to people like rural Belarusians, the opposition, or the intellectual elite
Moved to America in late 2003 - early 2004 from my homeland of Belarus
No, but they had the most casualties per capita in both of these conflicts
No-o-o-o! Who's annexing Bulgaria
* Babruisk (real and not that small jewish town in Belarus; the meme is from famous 1920th writers Ilf and Petrov)
We have some places that provide documentation in Belarusian, while others don't. There was an example a few years ago where someone demanded to receive a military draft notice in Belarusian (since it's one of the official languages and thus he had a constitutional right to do so) and the "Belarusian" he received was laughable "trasianka" (equivalent of your "surzhyk") full of ridiculous mistakes
Please
This is amazing to hear
Unfortunately it's impossible to be neutral when you have natural resources and gun pointing at your head all the time by the guys who really love to bring "democracy" on the missiles in countries that have oil
Oh, definitely
The arrested are kept in inhumane anti-sanitary conditions
I'm surprised we're not last
In Russian it's [sneg] with firm -s
French and Ukrainian are also very pretty
Australia,
"Провинция"
But they have to do it in front of OMON (our brutal police, yup, those guys in helmets)
Seems about as logical as the US invading Sweden or something like that
Yeah, these ones for the same reason, plus French and Russian (because literally everyone knows these), and Polish and Ukrainian due to reason of proximity
Otherwise Poland have to commemorate Sanacja victims as well
Now you can actually meet them in Minsk, some years ago it was almost impossible to meet someone form Westert country
Russian doesn't need to be taught 5 days a week (+2 literature) and also as a language for instruction in every other subject - that's true
You could also get there from the Belorussian side of the border, but I wouldn't recommend it
It starts with "We Belarusian are peacefull people".
The "squirrel" thing seems universal among German speakers, not just the ones that are "new" to English, though
I believe this is the first time I heard Angela Merkel's voice
The line is blurry
I still don't get the logic of that action
English-speaking media coverage of Belarus is almost non-existent

Belarusians are actually like Ukraine more these days
all other european countries get hand drawn unique pics and belarus gets shafted with the regular girl and just a pic of protests
How did they detect the nationality
I can sort of relate (well, not the German part), though you do get used to it eventually, once you get tired of giving the same speech correcting foreigners over and over
>Now you say Oachkatzlschwoaf (squirrels tail in Bavarian)
Trus in Russian is a coward
The same happens in any country with enought space
Measures of a much milder sort running for just a couple of years in the early 90s caused a backlash that was part of the reason for Lukashenko's rise, so getting anything anywhere near your level of government support is sci-fi in Belarus
What if the country doesn't have any people here
I don'r agree, renaming brings nothing
Stalin is not fcking saint, but I hate lies and exaggeration
A large part of the nation thinks "I better stay away from this and will be safe".
Besides salary Russia is behind Belarus in  every other index, ecology, life longevity, corruption, criminal activity, etc
Former Soviet republics which always were popularized in Soviet times as brothers, friends etc
Anyone concerned already knows
