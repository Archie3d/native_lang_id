With some modernity bias:
A group in power of the region identifies as that and enforces it on others by means of propaganda and  etc this is what exactly happened in Cyprus
Even Nicosia, which has the most robust bus network, has routes that are designed to force everyone to go through the Solomou Square Central Station in the city centre, even if they want to move laterally in the city

The fourth largest party and the rest of the MPs are rarely relevant in the legislative process, their votes usually matter if the official opposition is trying to pass a law (but most of the times, even if they manage to pull it off, the President vetoes it or it gets annulled by the equivalent of a Constitutional Court)

That's not a question about Turkey and Cyprus indeed
Hey
According to Varlokosta (2011), when confronted with unfamiliar words, Greek speakers have an extremely high accuracy (95~99%) when it comes to providing the matching article for unambiguously feminine and masculine words

In Cyprus, the student's parents have to officially declare that "our family adheres to a religion different to Orthodox Christianity and therefore we ask for our child to be exempted from Religion class".

When I was at university I felt like a fish out of the water
At least we, with a minimum investment of 2m, only admitted politicians who robbed their entire country's wealth and made a run for it
Yeah, that’s how it sound to me too
So what I'm saying is by taking a step towards this which we already did (European Union) we are moving closer towards a world government slowly but it will get there maybe in 100 years maybe in 1000

The international community doesn't acknowledge the existence of another state in Cyprus (that's why the only representative of TCs is Mr Akinci as the leaser of the TC community because he is directly elected by TCs and Mr Tatar can't represent TCs abroad
**Positive vote:** For any decision made by the Federal Government a positive Turkish Cypriot vote is needed
Well, it is an occupation
For another, there's a fifth of the Cypriot population which is traditionally Sunni Muslim and is committed to secularism and strongly oppose religious education in schools (which nevertheless increasingly happens against their will as Turkey tightens their cultural grip on Cyprus)
the formula says that both President and vicepresident are voted by all Cypriots
very bad drivers, a lot of buses I've heard one time in rural villages like in Famagusta or up in the mountains

Lmao, no it’s not
I have heard that Azerbaijani is similar to Turkish but how mutually intelligible are they
However Turkish Cypriots (/Turkey since in reality they are the ones who have the final say in this and not TCs) won't even negotiate for a Unitary State ,  Turkish nationalists want full-on partition of the island into 2 sperate states so BFF is what GC politicians are advocating for

The Council of Ministers' discretion is pretty wide, but it doesn't include Cypriots born to one Turkish parent after 1974 which is pretty targeted as far as legislation goes
Since we elect presidents in a two-round run-off election, if the two runner-ups (say B & C) are about as popular but one of them you really hate and/or consider a threat in the second round, then you may not vote for your favourite candidate in the first round if they are leading the polls

It would be controversial if they weren’t born in Greece or Cyprus
I mean I don't remember the village but I think it was in the Famagusta district
French is though
I am not a dual citizen, just a resident/emigrant
I have been waiting for a question like this lol
**The Gutteres Framework includes the six main aspects of the Cypriot problem:**
(I don't know who he is but having the same guy ruling for so long means democracy is in trouble
Limassol looks more modern compared to other places in Cyprus
Ioannina
We will get to an analysis on the Annan plan tomorrow morning
That’s exactly why
* *Greek-speaking Cypriot (GSC)*
I am from Nicosia and I went to Pa(ph)os, where I couldn’t understand them easy
&#x200B;
Κοκορέτσι (Kokoretsi- eaten during Easter consisting of lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned offal, including sweetbreads, hearts, lungs, or kidneys)
The framework states that issues related to troops (numbers, withdrawals if and when they will need to leave, timelines, etc
Secondarily, the geoinformation system sucks
Slightly better public transport, there's a demilitarised zone running through the middle, you have to drive more than 20 minutes to reach a beach, and the summers are more hot because it's further away from the shore
Yeah but changing its name in English to be its name in Greek would trigger Turkish Cypriots
I believe i saw it somewhere, hold on
Bye is the normal in Cyprus(since you have to enter and exit at the back)
wither way you'd still find yourself somewhere up on a mountain not knowing wtf you're doing
Indeed
We have pretty much unrestricted right to dual citizenship, and I haven't read a single article supporting restricting it
I don't want to go technical here since the point of this thread is to have some fun seeing how different word order can be in different languages
I didn't know that it has always been there
Unfortunately the fingers have all been pointed at Bureaucrats in Brussels and Cheap-Labour Poles and Muslim Terrorists and Benefit Thieves rather than the fuckers in charge who caused all of this, and tada
so long story short, GC citizens overall do not support reunification of the island, whereas TC citizens want reunification
For 1 second, I thought he was Ernesto Che Guevara
I think every monarch of Greece was a foreigner, or at least partly foreign
It's nice that bike road are staryingtto become popular(hopefully they will expand-a new plab for decentralisation of the state is coming and hopefully that will give the power(politically and financially) to municipalities to develop more
At least we, with a minimum investment of 2m, only admitted politicians who robbed their entire country's wealth and made a run for it
We also have the phrase « illiterate man, undressed timber» which is so cliché. Every primary school teacher would say this
Unfortunately, as with most of Chrysanthou's filmography, barely anyone wants to distribute it
There are more villages like this(Pyrgos which is a small one making it super isolated)
Hi, wanna talk to me
[2] But instead they attempted to remove the "Cypriot" sounds that don't exist in Greece Greek, e.g. attempting to rename the town La**tch**a into La**kk**ia
I assume those too, but the people I have in mind are mostly academics and businesspeople
It's a very beautiful and interesting history that is sadly hidden even from its people
I guess that's major reason why Luxembourg was always in the heart of regional integration initiatives
And there's no way out of using a national layout if you write in Greek or one of the many languages using Cyrillic
Also government buildings only have the Cypriot and EU flags
Sun: Hλιος - Helios (male, an ancient greek god)
**Republic of Cyprus:**
Because you can make a caricature about every religion
[1] E.g. the town known in Greek as Morphou and in pre-1974 Turkish as Omorfo, became Güzelyurt
50% of the High Parliament will be TCs
All jobs are important and they all contribute to society
Cyprus is not in Europe as well geographically, modern Turkish people are Anatolian genetically just their identity is "Turkish"
We of course understand you as this is the language we are taught, hear on the news and read
What if the reason that many of them don't want to return to Turkey forever *yet* is the existence of a presidential dictatorship
But yeah ik what you mean
Yes there is Volt as well
Cyprus has had numerous problems throughout its endless history, so despite being the 3rd oldest civilisation in the world, the country was officially founded in 1960
[Loizidou v. Turkey] [Apostolides v Orams] [Güzelyurtlu and others v. Cyprus and Turkey] and for a change of theme [Modinos v. Cyprus]
I’ve heard Turkish is a difficult language to learn
Well, it is an occupation
why even let non-EU companies to participate in the first place
You mean Ottoman (No its not the same thing at all)
For those who are out of employment, there is a strong safety net and of course family help
>Power points: In Ireland, we have the big, clunky UK 3 pin plug; using the same plugs as mainland Europe would make buying electrical appliances much easier and would offer greater choice to the consumer
The pronunciation ιμέιλ stands out for me, so that's the one I remembered
For half a century Armenians that survived the genocide and Turkish Cypriots lived in peace (which is pretty extraordinary)
We are perhaps fighting a tougher battle here because we have the legacies of very recent and sometimes still on-going wars making people more insular and apprehensive, but I really object to the notion that we need outside saviours to replace our political cultures with theirs
Why is the words combined, why not morgen brød instead
are you pewdiepie
If I am working service and I have a queue forming up behind you, please just use English
Are you somehow implying that the right to vote should be conditional on what a group is likely to vote for
> If I have a bad day, having a nice chat with a barista or taxi driver can be massive in lifting up my mood
One of the most famous ones  was that of 1963-1964
There's no dedicated school bus for the primary schools inside the village - only that bus that would take us to the next village for middle school and high school
Larnaca doesn't have that good beaches, but yep, still amazing
No, you got it wrong, and I don't really see why
I am way worse at translating now
> I feel like everyone is talking at cross-purposes on the question
He just said posibol
I have a Belgian friend, and she told me her parents were very uncomfortable with her moving to Germany, and that she herself is still triggered by the stereotypical "Aryan" look some German men naturally sport
A group in power of the region identifies as that and enforces it on others by means of propaganda and  etc this is what exactly happened in Cyprus
> Is switching to the standard dialect something people do
Montenegro in the EU isn't that high in my wishlist :P
It would have to be during Frankish (1192-1489) and Venetian rule (1489–1571)
But it's very easy for political forces that want to privatise healthcare and introduce a non-universal system to attack the NHS now, in its infancy
Yeah, there's the language aspect too
Electrical appliances in general were in trouble because of the sudden power cut outs
You are the only other Cypriot I see active on r/europe :)
And that wouldn't be more effective against viruses than standard soap, afaik
All parties here asked the government last year to make steps to get rid of the british bases(there was a decision from the International Law of Justice about a similar case for Mauritius that called the bases illegal because it violate the right of self determination in those areas)
That's why a unitary state solutions is preferred by most Greek Cypriots over a BFF
Unlike GCs parties that are all against a two state solution, the rightist TC parties no longer support the UN agreed model of solution and support either a two state solution or a confederation of two states
I just hope the cypriot mentality of having a nice car at 17, buying a super expensibe mercedes just to show off even if you can't afford it, considering it offensive for someone to use a bus will stop
It has modern architecture and skyscrapers
What does the Gutteres Framework says
Within a rounding error, all Turkish citizens who enter Cyprus after 1974 do so in what constitutes illegal ports of entry for this law (all ports of entry in the northern side are considered illegal, it's very hard for a Turkish citizen to get a Visa from RoC in order to enter from legal ports of entry)
For you to understand what these are we have to to back in 1960 when the Republic of Cyprus was created
Is saying just 'μέιλ' more common in Greece
Good job
The two dominant parties are always opposed to each other
I hate that ELOT standard

Who's politically in charge matters for details at the micro-level, but  it doesn't change the macro level
The above are pretty much agreed
I really don’t know why, but your country is always associated with gypsies in Cyprus
EDIT: Of course, I always forget to consider that not all countries are islands
⁠Γουι χαβ ολρεντι ιτεν δε καμελ, γουι ναου χαβ δε κιου.
All the shops and buildings proceeded to buy huge generators for their business and buildings for the elevators
Locals were already living together mixed and happy they were transported from Turkey to Greece and vice versa according to the treaties between the two countries not according to individual choices
Yes I am not saying you are wrong but if you wanted to convince people you don't need to be that agressive in this situation since almost everyone would understand your point and thats why there is no need to be aggresive about it, being agressive would not convince people that well instead they would show agressiveness towards you ignoring your initial point
I had to go and visit some Cypriot newspapers to see what they do
I will talk you about both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, the Annan plan, the Gutteres Framework, the last negotiations in Crans Montana and much more
A more accessible runner-up is [Sharing an Island] (2011)
Turkish Cypriot side is more divided on that
Still, I think most Cypriots are at least able to distinguish native and non-native English speakers, even if they can't guess what the person's native language actually is
I mean, that's not in your country though, is it
You are thinking of "author's moral rights". That's in additional, mostly European, set of rights that sits on top of copyright law
As long as we don't have external interference, I believe it is far more likely we live peacefully than killing each other
Thank you for your rude comment very interesting indeed
>Driving on the same side of the road - In Ireland we drive on the left side of the road, whereas in most European countries (after Brexit, I think the exceptions will only be Ireland and Malta) drivers drive on the right side
> In that case the ID or passport would write "Gouilliam or William" (same for last names)
And Dhekelia is sandwiched between the districts of Larnaca and Famagusta but not really touching any city
So this is a main topic that was being discuss a lot after the failure in Crans Montana
The question wasn't contribution in the defeat of Germany
One side was smarter & knew how to get more votes
So, our talented people go to Greece to find success
If you looked as of right now to the cultures of those countries you will notice that there are many many similarities both genetic and cultural, although the latter is more common
Napoleon is part of Italian history btw, but yeah got your point
For the technical terminology here, this is about indirect objects (έμμεσα αντικείμενα) in different cases (πτώσεις)
Are you sure
They most likely took into account our grossly overinflated and overpaid public service
Bye is the normal in Cyprus(since you have to enter and exit at the back)
We literally have a picture of it on our flag
We have to zoom-in at least at regional level
In the North, there are hundreds of thousands of Turks that were brought to Cyprus after the war and of course many who were born here
Wow that's interesting
My birthday = my treat
Non-Greek speakers who come to Cyprus for their Erasmus baffle me, since with a few exceptions, instruction is in Greek
True, they fucked up a lot of place names with the Greekification in the late 90s. I think though that, at least on main roads, Nicosia will be mentioned in brackets after Lefkosia
I use buses to go to Nicosia
I don't have that distinction, and in my life I've heard ζήλια used for both "active" (κάμνει το που ζήλεια) and "passive" (ζηλέφκει που...) desire
It's less of "we don't talk about this" and more of "okay then, lets go outside and settle this once and for all". No justice was served then, and people are itching to either punish the coupists, or to defend them from the non-adjudicated allegations
Bi-zonal: 2 zones
Malta, Greece, Italy, Armenia, Lebanon
(the ratio is 30% TCs even though the population was 18%)
There's no dedicated school bus for the primary schools inside the village - only that bus that would take us to the next village for middle school and high school
I've read other comments here  that Catholic countries (Spain, Italy, Austria) signed a treaty with Vatican teaching kids the Catholic faith
Public school teachers, when seen as an organised societal group, lean conservative hard and any government attempt to reform the educational system towards a non-confessional or non-militant orientation is opposed
Dying in an ottoman prison
If it's Pontic with a lot of loanwords from Greek and written, I can sort of get the gist
That's so cool
I don’t think Cyprus has any best kept secrets, so imma use Greece
Oh wow, that's a great citation, so the old sense was at least still familiar in the 80s. It's a shame we don't have sufficiently large databases for the Greek language to investigate when the modern sense of the word was first used
Later, my mum got a car so she'd drive me
"It sounds like Spanish" for some odd reason
Also what would happen to the Turkish Settlers
It attracts rich Russians, Arabs and Israelis
It's kinda obvious since all Europe use km/h(these are the signs used in the street and they also don't say it) except UK and for UK it says mph
in the mountains outside Limassol, idk exactly where, but, there is a wonderful art Museum about the history of Cyprus
A pack of 50 plain single-use surgical masks shouldn't be sold for over 10 EUR
Well I’m terrified:)
This may be because IKEA in Nicosia is right opposite the General Hospital
In cyprus whatever the speed limit is everyone goes 19km over
**- Territory**
Basil (that's literally how we call him)  instead of Santa Claus (St
The President was Makarios III
We agree:)
I think territory is not a main disagreement
It's actually growing pretty fast
We use Microsoft Teams
Calling it a  border is politically controversial since there is mutual non-recognition of sovereignty, but:
I can’t think of one actually (apart from - the)
A more accessible runner-up is [Sharing an Island] (2011)
"Died in committee" is more EU's style
Your birthday = your treat
Similarly, if you are voting for a minor candidate in the first round normally, but B & C are really close and you think C is beyond horrible, you may abandon your losing candidate for B. (Voting for minor candidates is not always a waste, because having upper-single digits levels of support still gives them enough leverage to ask for a minor cabinet position by promising to direct their voters to one of the leading candidates in the second round)

A minority language in a country might not be a dialect
Governments of foreign countries don't get to change your name, they have an international duty to accept other countries' travel documents
They are legally there since it is a part of our Constitution
Do you think such a post would make sense in /r/AskEurope, or will it be only Greek Cypriots and Greek answering
> Yep, so you need to go to the Greek side to have a baby with any hope of a passport, how messed up is that
The dog thing doesn't apply to older people, at least in the Mediterranean  region
There is a chance there is something wrong with Belarus but apparently with all that's going on there not many people said anything (Stay strong Belarusian People, Fight for Democracy)
With enough exposure, they can understand most of it (except the culturally specific pragmatic nuances)
Right
people don’t really do that anymore
Yeah, that’s how it sound to me too
Nowadays I place more faith on local grassroots campaigns on very specific issues
Even Nicosia, which has the most robust bus network, has routes that are designed to force everyone to go through the Solomou Square Central Station in the city centre, even if they want to move laterally in the city
This is the second map from that amazing guy that I reposted(I only did it because he encourages and thanks people who do that)

After all, I even heard of some people giving presents on Christmas instead of New Year
In these countries they prefer strong employment protections, job security and high investment in the workforce

Here it's 20% minus one (so 119)
You won't see any Cypriot in the busses (maybe some high school students), all of the passengers are Turkish settlers and students etc

In towns (κωμόπολη to be exact) and villages, that's not done - or at least it wasn't done when I was a child

I'd say IKEA is popular in Cyprus, but definitely considered cheap outlet - acceptable house furniture, but not for professional use
Both after-war populations grew up in a nationalistic (under the facade of *patriotism*) educational system and with virtually no contact with each other

Pretty much everything is divided in two

Also it would be different if you spoke to someone bigger in age to you, or not a friend/ person you know/ is close to you
people from Larnaca are arguably the most civilized in Cyprus and that's amazing

The serpents and the snakes have half-eaten him
That's interesting
you are putting me in a inferior position as (immature) just to justify your stand
I hate drinking white milk but I do use milk
Greek Cypriots living in the same town are actually quite likely to know each other, so when they see a Greek Cypriot child roaming outside alone they already know where to find the parent, and police doesn't get involved
I think it's the feeling that we belong in a bigger family, although being different
Oh ok
The serpents and the snakes have half-eaten him
I doubt that could happen in any other country (especially one that call it/herself European)
I wouldn’t associate skin colour with health
> - children of mixed marriages T / C with Turkish citizens where the marriage took place abroad before July 20, 1974
There are exceptions and I think I am one of them, but Europeans who come to Cyprus to work for a while always note how remarkably little we care about or feel part of the EU and the subcontinent
(or it can never be established
Now all of them are closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus outbreak
The TC right doesn't accept for reason a United Cyprus without Turkish guarantees(they also don't support United Cyrus but okay)

Well, the current problem our system is facing (except for COVID19 having broke it) is the so-called "supermarket mentality", where people show up at their GP with a list of specialist referrals they want and pages upon pages of tests and diagnostics they want to do, without any medical indications

I’m Greek Cypriot, though I don’t think that’s how most Greek Cypriots view the situation

Because of the occupation some places are more isolated than the rest of the country so a solution to the cypriot problem would really help everything (the town/village I live-I study in Athens now- is 35 mins from Nicosia by driving now but before the turkish invasion it was 13 mins
Now that the bus stop is 10 minutes away from my house for lykeio the bus that picks the students from the villages 20minutes away picks us up again then a different bus  takes us to evrychou but before when 2009 when villages has bigger population and their own schools the kids walked

We want and need their solidarity, and we can learn from their experiences, but ultimately there's a local flavour to the conservatism we are up against, so we only those with that local knowledge can bring change that is more than skin-deep and that can last

While the atrocities commited by Nazi Germans were approved and instigated by the Nazi government, atrocities commited against Turkish Cypriots was committed by anti-government terrorists (which killed many Greek Cypriots as well mind you)

As a result, they remain in a limbo of statelessness until they say 'fuck it, I will apply for a Turkish passport'.

Although it might not fit in with the [457 year old Venetian Walls] as the mayor said (from his eyesore of a city hall), “it’s a breath of European air”
As far as the news are concerned we are certainly well informed about Greek politics but they are not so much mentioned in the news

It's tragic that Cyprus is sunny 95%of the year and we have so little renewable energy
It has expensive restaurants, 5* hotels, it is also a shipping hub and has a lot of amenities
The progressive half of the political spectrum in Cyprus is practically empty

Nowadays with co-productions there are numerous TV series that are filmed in both countries with both Greek and Cypriot actors
Finally, Cyprus Police is more likely to let Greek Cypriot parents (compared to non-Greek Cypriots) get away with warnings instead of starting criminal investigations each time there's a report against them

I doubt it will happen in the end, but it will be a true mess if it's not the same as both Greece and Turkey
It seems to me that federation “omospondia” as they call it, is the most popular “solution”. But the island would still be somewhat divided in that sense
You can see the differences that people from different parts of Turkey have it is still a multi-ethnic country united under the Turkish identity
However we have a couple good private ones aswell like the University of Nicosia (UNIC) .
It's one of the four seats of the Greek community
This could’ve been said in the plural form of politeness
"If you say they want reunification, why did GCs said NO to the Annan plan
At that point, we either listened to THAT, or modern greek music
TCs are regarded as legal owners of their properties in the southern part of the island
If our cypriot dialect isn't a reason for reunification, I don't know what is
GCs vote for GCs, TCs vote for TCs, two official languages
Why displace them like they did with us in the 1920s of course
When the odd email arrives from a Greek speaker or an external person and I have to reply in Greek, my mind freezes and I can't even compose a Greek email

My point is that it's rare for families to organise any Christmas-related festivities on Christmas Eve, because we don't have a tradition on doing that (and we don't have a tradition of doing that, because when the holiday wasn't as secular as it is now, people weren't allowed to have dinners)
Fellahs (Uneducated Turkish settlers that were illegaly placed in peoples homes in order to turkify the occupied land
So what I'm saying is by taking a step towards this which we already did (European Union) we are moving closer towards a world government slowly but it will get there maybe in 100 years maybe in 1000

On the one hand, you have strong labour market protections
We couldn't be a more unrepresentative bunch for Cyprus
And Turks always seem to omit the fact that they invaded Cyprus in order to protect The Turkish Cypriots but you ended up staying forever and started sending illegal settlers to the island
Ayia Napa entirely bases itself on tourism so I mean they kinda need to have the signs
Do you think such a post would make sense in /r/AskEurope, or will it be only Greek Cypriots and Greek answering
To the most part that’s true, and sad
Indeed, and it's important to emphasise because in some other Orthodox-majority countries it's different: in Cyprus, baptism has no legal effect
People have a pretty good opinion of Ford Focus, it just is a dumb stereotype that USA doesn't produce good cars
I would say Turkey but

45 years have passed and Turkey is still illegally occupying Cyprus' territory
2) Since 1963 when Turkish Cypriots left the governmental bodies and the Parliament, their seats in the Parliament remain there empty

I wouldn't paint Cypriots with a single brush, since for one there is vocal opposition, just not a successful one

As a rising economic power and already the second biggest without even unleasing its full potential, China is looking like the next great superpower, soon passing the US, and with the rapid urbanisation, it's going to be difficult to compete without the support of the Chinese Market
It was agreed in 1977 that the solution to the cypriot problem would be achieved bi negotiations under the umbrella of the United Nations and United Cyprus would be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation

We register Μιχάλης, Γιώργος, Θανάσης, etc if that's what the parents wanted
Opinions are different on what led us to the occupation between the leftists and the rightists and that's something that isn't discusses often between them
I wouldn't call anti-Turkey view nationalistic we are in a war with them after all
It is pretty common
nost are English and Russian
it remains the hottest topic in the political scene of Cyprus for 50+ years
People don't really like the idea of their president being a TC (or even worse a Turk) because he won't represent the majority of the people
Ohhhh
No one said this
They also don't have many or any family in Cyprus to help with child-rearing in the place of a partner other than slightly older siblings taking care of their younger ones
Whence are-you
Also it would be different if you spoke to someone bigger in age to you, or not a friend/ person you know/ is close to you
In the grand scale of things a lot worse things happened in Cyprus during and after the war than name changes, but it still greatly offended the locals
The "bird" of Cyprus
It is agreed that a part of the area currently occupied will be returned to the GCs and will be part of the GC zone

If politics stay in the current trajectory, it's entirely conceivable that this would happen to northern Cyprus too and it's going to be stranger than fiction
With that in mind, in Greek I answer the phone with "**parakaló**" (literally: "please", ~bitte), and in English with "**hello**".

Before I get into that I have to tell you that the leaders of the Cypriot communities were present in the negotiations of all sections
>absolutely catastrophic customer service
Yeah a Turkish Cypriot told me that as well which is also very interesting
Another major problem is the presence of Turkish troops on the island , GC want them to leave since we want an independent country
Name changes aren't particularly difficult in Cyprus in any case, if a Τάσος from birth decides they want to be officially known as Αναστάσης or Αναστάσιος in adulthood, they can just change it at the Civil Registry
That's not a question about Turkey and Cyprus indeed
Both sides knew how *democracy* works way before the election/referendum date
Independence day was on 16 of August
That’s what I’ve heard
I know it's not their fault that they are here and they have known no other homeland but it is sill a touchy subject for GCs
The above means that they are in a position where they have to let their children walk alone to school, afternoon activities, or playground and/or stay at home alone after school more often than married women and/or women whose extended family lives in Cyprus do

A friend of mine was called a whore by random people and given looks because she was wearing a skirt probably, it was in southern region of turkey
Technically our monarchs and technically not
We were more lax about it in the beginning, but we have adopted it in the last decade
It seems complicated, and even if all Cypriots wanted this, I still think we wouldn’t be able to achieve it, especially if our old pal Turkey isn’t fond of it
(considering that economically, politically and militarily is dependent on Turkey) or do you think that such a relationship can ve established only if the cypriot problem is resolved

Reading Greek however is pretty straight forward as letters and letter combinations have only one sound each . Stress is also always indicated with an accent . The only part that's not as predictable is when the /i/ sound is pronounced as /j/ when it is followed by another vowel but that's something that only foreign speakers may struggle with .

We have pretty much unrestricted right to dual citizenship, and I haven't read a single article supporting restricting it
Fingers crossed, this will happen soon and it will succeed
There also times where a constant is written 2 times but its pronunciation is the same in standard greek  for example t and tt make the same sound
Edit: grammar
Usually during naturalisation the restrictions will be more relaxed than the restrictions they apply on citizens from birth
it remains the hottest topic in the political scene of Cyprus for 50+ years

Greece - Ελλάδα (Hellada)
Since we elect presidents in a two-round run-off election, if the two runner-ups (say B & C) are about as popular but one of them you really hate and/or consider a threat in the second round, then you may not vote for your favourite candidate in the first round if they are leading the polls

I found the British people I meet in person to be sufficiently aware and regretful of colonialism
Cypriot Greek is still diverse enough so that people can tell if you are from a specific district, but there's definitely a process called 'dialect levelling' going on
It was allegedly important in the last European Parliament Elections, where there are only 6 seats and Cyprus is a single constituency (the claim is that declining EDEK (S&D) wouldn't get the last seat if it wasn't for voters of all other parties voting for them so that the neonazi party wouldn't win that seat)

At the same time, I am -not so willingly- a National Guard reservist and I could be called to fight a war I may consider unjust and self-destructive, my family exclusively lives in Cyprus and their well-being is absolutely affected by Cypriot politics, and of course, the all-time American classic: I'm a tax payer
Talking to people from Greece who haven't been in Cyprus for a sufficient amount of time (in the ballpark of 3 months) is also one of the situations we are socialised to use Standard Greek for

According to TCs
Turkish settlers, where, when; everytime I go out soon Cypriots will be exterminated so I guess they are the ones having a culture shock in our island
The Cypriot presidential system especially has next to zero checks and balances

So the referendum will determine the future of the TC community (the one of the two communities of the legal state, RoC)

Hey
Greek Cypriot public schools have a confessional religion class, i.e. it's a class that presupposes that you are Greek Orthodox Christian and aims to strengthen your faith and provide you with the Church's philosophical and social stances on a series of issues
Cyprus cannot be correctly understood if it's just examined as a European country, or if it's just examined as an Asian country
There are many that want reunification but don't want the proposed solution because according to them it's unfair
It doesn't help that whenever we try to describe our location we just say next to  Greece
That's less threatening than giving it a proper role to serve in the classroom, even if that role is to facilitate high proficiency in the standard language (e.g. by comparison of equivalent structures and explicit comparison of the differences on all linguistic levels)

The fourth largest party and the rest of the MPs are rarely relevant in the legislative process, their votes usually matter if the official opposition is trying to pass a law (but most of the times, even if they manage to pull it off, the President vetoes it or it gets annulled by the equivalent of a Constitutional Court)

In reality, however, TSCs are full citizens of RoC but GSC not of "TRNC". While in theory, the TSCs could move to the more developed South (very few TSCs live in the South) the social implications are such that they make that a rather difficult reality

The only exception might be modern Greek teachers but that still depends on the teacher
The Greek ampersand is only used in handwriting, since Microsoft decided not to include it in its Greek keyboard (similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)

so long story short, GC citizens overall do not support reunification of the island, whereas TC citizens want reunification
I am not in high risk myself, nor I am doing anything to increase my risk
Separate elections
The dog thing doesn't apply to older people, at least in the Mediterranean  region
It has two bad outcomes: either a wildly unpopular executive stays in power because they only need broad acceptance on election day and have unchecked power for the rest of their terms, or their coalition partners abandon them a year before the legislative elections in order to campaign, meaning that the executive can't pass any laws in the parliament (e.g. this year, they might not even be able to pass the budget because legislative elections are coming up in 7 months)

When did this happen
Cycling is becoming a more popular mean of exercising, hopefully it will become a mean of transport as well(considering how small distances are)(my grandpa's generation could do it
In Cyprus, the student's parents have to officially declare that "our family adheres to a religion different to Orthodox Christianity and therefore we ask for our child to be exempted from Religion class". Irreligiosity is often not accepted as 'a different religion' (it's up to the school principal to accept or deny those applications) and those families are initially denied exemption until they escalate it all the way up to MinEdu
This is a multidimensional issue, and i have already reduced it a lot

I love that part

So this is a main topic that was being discuss a lot after the failure in Crans Montana
The issue of power sharing should be discussed further in relation to the issue of a  positive vote, namely when and under what conditions and in which bodies  this could be exercised, with concurrent provisions for mechanisms to  resolve issues that have reached deadlock

Cypriot Greek is still diverse enough so that people can tell if you are from a specific district, but there's definitely a process called 'dialect levelling' going on

There are exceptions and I think I am one of them, but Europeans who come to Cyprus to work for a while always note how remarkably little we care about or feel part of the EU and the subcontinent
Lol ok thanks
I know what it is . learned about it in history
To visit Turkey of what I read I will have to state that I am from the "Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus". Even though I would really like to visit it some day I won't deny the existence of the Republic of Cyprus to do so

No highways right

Sadly each side accept a different "version" of that framework

For example:
"Abandonment of a child under the age of 16" is the crime in question, and leaving a child at home for a few hours technically counts as that

Since no one knew how dangerous the cargo was and also they did not know how to store them, while been exposed  for a while in our environment with hot temperatures, fires and high levels of humidity, eventually they exploded, killing 12 people and leaving the whole country without electricity for 3-4 months
In Cyprus it might be on tv this weekend or on Christmas Eve
It is indeed in the best interests of all of us to unite the island

If someone who has worked in minds for 30 years and now is out of employment, where can he work
Judging from the responses of other Germans (and also Austrians) in this and other similar threads, I'm not as optimistic as you
I don’t think that’s mostly the case
\* Guterres’ framework says there is disagreement between the parties as to whether there will be a termination (sunset) or review clause
If unification were to happen, how is it going to happen

Ancient ruins have been found underneath it during its construction as well, which has forced them to make changes in the way it was to be built, as these “ruins” -basically a bunch of rocks, had to be shown through glass on the ground

Oh nice xD
I think people should be free to pursue whatever they want
I am a radio and newspaper person, and on those, news from Greece feature very little, not much more than other international news stories
We also have some local productions
With enough exposure, they can understand most of it (except the culturally specific pragmatic nuances)
"or anyone else in the EU " U sure
In Germany, well from my experience alone, also no
There’s a slight difference
people don’t really do that anymore
GC side agrees on that but only with a ratio 4:1 (Greek Nationals:Turkish Nationals)The agreed population ratio between GCs and TCs is 4:1 so that way neither Greeks nor Turks will affect the demographics of the island
Goes to show you what sort of power operating system defaults yield, they eradicated two punctuation points from Greek

TC side supports that the "users" that have GC properties should not have not abandon the houses and properties of GCs and isyead be considered as owners of these properties
At the men's toilets I saw that Dutch men would only momentarily put a few of their fingers under water and call this hand-washing

It also laid the foundations of the Ottoman conquest that it was to follow
I am not even touching upon what happens with loanwords, because that's an entire book volume on its own
I mean this apply to Crete(a greek island) too,
Yes, of course
Yeah, one has to be very cautious with adjectives like that, because they obscure so much nuance, and they also reinforce some rather problematic ideas about human rights somehow being specifically a 'European culture'.
The class itself isn't taken seriously by students with older students (14-18 year olds ) sneakely doing homework for other subjects during the lessons
GC side supports that all the refugees should be able to return to their home and het back their properties
Any opposition to this approach comes when they are older and have found a sense of self-confidence from a different source
"If you say they want reunification, why did GCs said NO to the Annan plan

Nowadays with co-productions there are numerous TV series that are filmed in both countries with both Greek and Cypriot actors

I'm asking because on the one hand, people when asked they are in favour in general (recent Poll that was posted here recently, for instance France is far more Eurosceptic than Sweden), on the other hand it seems that it does not want further integration, it kept the krona and it was part of the frugal 4

Cyprus goes to the other extreme
Reading Greek however is pretty straight forward as letters and letter combinations have only one sound each . Stress is also always indicated with an accent . The only part that's not as predictable is when the /i/ sound is pronounced as /j/ when it is followed by another vowel but that's something that only foreign speakers may struggle with .
I dunno, I can understand having a small number of limitations on names, like reasonable length and nothing that is obviously harmful to the child, but I can't justify giving the government the right to decide which variant of my name I should have on my papers

Yes true, that was already the case at least since the 2000s. But again here, it was always critical to make sure that Cypriot Greek wasn't elevated to the role of a means of instruction
Do you need to study them first a bit
That's already a big concession for Greek Cypriots, even though that's what the major parties are advocating for in negotiations that's not the ideal solution for most Greek Cypriots
As you see the according to the TC side these two are not part of the negotiations and are already agreed by both sides

Many of them have been now resolved, but the situation in Cyprus is still dynamic - Cyprus is an extremely multilingual place to begin with and Cypriot Greek is the most active of all Greek dialects and perhaps the only one that could potentially "threaten" standard Greek if there was any appetite to do that

Pro: Great Greek music in the last 4~5 decades, you all deserve to be able to enjoy it
this involved education
I think if a person from Mainland Greece gets enough exposure he will understand Cypriot Greek
You saw someone you know
Right now I have two keyboards in use
At least 4 times more
As a Cypriot I can assure you that I know the Greek anthem just as good as I know the Cypriot one
Eerily similar, but vastly more destructive than [our worst explosion] I hope the Cyprus government is doing everything they can to help Lebanon, and not limit themselves to thoughts and prayers
People may be suffering because they country took such a political turn that it has become unliveable for them, to such extend that they have emigrated
People used to be mocked for using a lot of words from the dialect and it was ( and still is) what we call "village-y" which is associated with the uneducated villager stereotype that existed more than 50 years ago
I still wonder how that’s connected to modern English or even Shakespearian English
I have some cousins that were born there and I am wondering of they can speak Welsh at all
I think the same applies for the generations of 40+
*Lefkosía* is the Greek name for the city and the oldest of the three names, *Lefkoşa* is the Turkish name for the city derived from the Greek name, and *Nicosia* is the Italian/Latin/Internationalised name for it derived also from the Greek but with a regular sound change
But of course, culturally there's extreme pressure in getting baptised
If our cypriot dialect isn't a reason for reunification, I don't know what is
What the Gutteres Framework says
So if you are a Tunisian who knows Italian, you can easily learn Maltese
You are exaggerating
The rest are dying/dead, either because of Standard Greek popularity, or because of the Greek genocide

a) If you are a representative of an organisation, you identify your self first - no matter who called who
Wasn’t there a Bloody Sunday in Russia too
I agree with your points
People I meet in Europe know Limassol and Paphos from their vacations, and Larnaca because of the airport there
No way in hell is that the average salary for Cyprus for the common folk
&#x200B;
I feel that pay a few cents as a 'service fee' each time I buy something with cash so that those coins stay out of my wallet
It's always controversial of course
Girl: Victoria, Elizabeth
The ELOT one would be unpronounceable
Now i dont want to be mean but Nicosia is the prettiest followed by Larnaca, Paphos and then Limassol
Oh to be 20 and be convinced that you will be forever invincible :P
The problem is totally not us destroying the planet but the fucking aesthetics
My external keyboard is the [typical Greek-English keyboard] which is derived from the US English QWERTY but in addition to the introduction of Alt Gr where Right Alt is, it has the two-storey Enter key (like [ISO] does), and has the € symbol on the third level of the key for 'ε'.
Especially since the internal borders close, you can only drive for two hours before you fall into the sea
The Parliament is elected separately
Brexit
Unfortunately after all these years many people died without returning to their homes
You're welcome
Yeah that's why I was thinking best case scenario Belgium

In Cypriot Greek, the following feel natural to me but afaik the younger generation has imported a lot more terms in the language:

Deutschlandlied is kinda bad, Horst-Wessel-lied is
That was still when COVID-19 wasn't considered a pandemic
well uh
What do you think would be a good solution for them in the new union
(I personally believe that those who are here, are of course entitled to citezinship of the new federal state, but   i fear that things can escalate quickly with this issue)
But the issue is definitely controversial and not far from reach at any given time
Is "TRNC" considered a (real) country by Turks
I've only been to Greeve and Malta ;-;
In the whole Cyprus everyone is reliant of a car
PREUßENS GLORIA IS BY FAR THE BEST GERMAN ANTHEM
But I know that this is subjective but at least something that is necessary such as sunshine in order to absorb vitamin D is essential
Maybe the Turkish Cypriot that created the cypriot flag also loved our cool shape:)
Larnaca is more "nornal" so to say
I don't know man, I love Linux too but I don't know how having sex with it would make things better

Isn’t he just as much of a nationalist as Putin is
Sadly that's what has led Britain to vote out of the EU
so be careful if you plan to visit
In 2011, there were at least 26 Ναπολέων living in Cyprus, but Ναβουχοδονόσορ must be one colourful character
At the age of 17 students start driving lessons, when they start studies (if they study in Cyprus) they have to buy a car

I support exactly the opposite thing
Nah government buuldings no longer have both xD(the have the cypriot and the EU)

TC side wants the turkish army to stay and live after a couple of years and a part of it to stay forever
Agreed
It asserts that both communities should feel safe in a federal Cyprus, and that the security of one should not come at the detriment of the other

Of course, I buy prepaid local SIMs for data where I go
Yes, they'd love to get back their properties (I doubt any of them would move back in) but it's more of a romantic dream
Maybe they compare it to their political systems
> I feel like everyone is talking at cross-purposes on the question
You are being a bit overdramatic, you could have phrased that much better now people will think you are a dickhead
Mixed feelings
Shit just relazied this is ask europe haha
What a way to annex land
maybe it's because i have an actual english accent like it's straight outta
> **who will judge the murderer…**
I didn't consider them separate languages though
They forgot to invite
That's really not the case with the Republic of Cyprus
Paphos
But it's nice to see that Greece Italy(and even Turkey) are appreciated by Western Europe for their efforts
It's always controversial of course
Yes
I know recent cases where the parents couldn't go with the name they wanted because of it
It wouldn't be possible to have a socialist EU country due to the common market and other regulations that are centralised to the EU
there’s also a lack of pavement in many areas
I don't think most parties have nationalist views like "Cyprus first" or "migrants should leave".
I mean if you take a look at everything the Greek Cypriot side accepted
It's still [Lent on the 24th] so for practising Greek Orthodoxs it would be very strange to celebrate and have dinners on the 24th
omg it's a freaking epidemic
People in Berlin seem to generally ride so-called sportsbikes, either rigid mountainbikes or roadbikes
28 for Cyprus, according you Eurostat: [
The Greek government did the Junta but everyone blames us Greek Cypriots
Most don't have a problem with using the dialect
I think it helps that Nowadays our youths can communicate and build trust and Ultima put those mistakes aside so that they can live together in harmony
What does the Gutteres Framework say
&#x200B;
you can go see Saint Nicholas and Agros, 2 places that make our bottled water but also have amazing hotels and tour grpups, as the beaty of the places is just phenomenal
Sure, but isn't rempetika older
The pronunciation ιμέιλ stands out for me, so that's the one I remembered
Having lived in all sorts of places in western/northern Europe, I have now gotten used to seeing children roam about freely, but the first few months were bizarre
2) Since 1963 when Turkish Cypriots left the governmental bodies and the Parliament, their seats in the Parliament remain there empty
Limassol, Paphos, Ayia Napa, they need to put all those signs because tourism

But I couldn't simply not reply to one-sided arguments
military rule
I’d say either Greece or Turkey
During that winter, after the incidient, the authorities in the northern side changed the working hours to compensate for the lost day light, and next winter they switched to following EET with a DST change at the same day as the southern side
The cycling infrastructure in Berlin is minimal and not well maintained, so you have to be comfortable riding on the road
> Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc
I wouldn't call anti-Turkey view nationalistic we are in a war with them after all
Now I trust our people are far more open minded
Close-knit workplaces would also appreciate it if you brought some zivania]
I say Πείπι ποuπου
**Bi-communal Bi-zonal Federation**
See, I kept finding it weird that people keep replying to me saying that, but I realised that maybe a lot of incoming Erasmus students go to our private universities
Here, I must mention that according to the Cypriot Constitution of 1959, all Cypriots are citizens of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) and as such can freely move, work and vote
for the past 5 minutes I've been thinking "Lol Lenin in Switzerland" and "Lol Socialist Mussolini"
Rotating Presidency with 2:1 ratio
Asking me to do work (like bring the treats or the cake) on your birthday is bizarre
Is your ancestral homeland really in central asia
I think Athens is prettier (mainly because of the ancients)
Most of your ancestors basically originate from proto-anatolians (for an average Turkish person, I do know that there are some villages that do show high amounts of Turkic ancestry) so why do Turks ignore their Anatolian roots and act like they are actually Turkic
Germany's anthem has gotten worse and worse over the years
A bit cynical, but I have to thank Greece for blackmailing the rest of the European Union in admitting Cyprus as a member state even though we had no reason to be there
Some very distant ones in the UK
It's only in the last half century that written and spoken Greek resemble each other
This area under the control of the Knights Templar (and subsequently the Knights Hospitaller) became known as Commandaria

It was summer and summer here in Cyprus hits 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit)
It was famously *not* declared a terrorist organisation, but instead a *criminal* organisation
Also recent drillings on our EEZ ain’t doing any good
They are glorifying this on social media in nationalistic posts
Oh damn idk what village you’re from but in Vyzakia,potami,astromeriti,Evrychou,kakopetria,akaki etc there was a bus (after 2009 when Dhmotiko asinou was built)
**Positive vote:** For any decision made by the Federal Government a positive Turkish Cypriot vote is needed
I did not call anyone a dickhead, You are using quatation marks on things I never said just to make a point, There is no argument there to be wrong or correct he is just saying I am "the only dick" here which is something I never said I did not call him a dickhead I just called his approach agressive which could result in people having an agressive response to his statement meaning they will think of him as an dickhead
(or it can never be established

Nicosia Cyprus capital has the ugliest sky line in Europe
Yeah:)
Though, I would Google an exchange student’s name to find who they are on social media, (as they are a stranger), I certainly wouldn’t brag about it, and would definitely not mention something as personal as a close relative let alone a parent passing away
That was a shock for me too (does it have anything to do with Mediterranean
I LOVE octopus wym
When someone is late we say "Is he coming from Τζιάος" (it's a village that in 1973-last census- had less than 1000 inhabitants)
Same in Greek Universities
GC side also wants that the GC zone will have at least 50% of the coastline
The Turkish occupation
It was a series of clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that resulted in the death of hundreds of Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the displacement of thousands more .
I have seen it in Manchester airport too
You still aren't invited into the club by the way
A part of TC community isnokay with the withdrawal of the Turkish army I think(better ask a TC on that)
They actually get paid well, yet we still use it, presumably due to the unpopularity of the job
Nope
Same, I had no idea
Some Orthodox Christians also oppose the confessional nature of the course, but they are a minority among their religion
I think I lean more towards a parliamentary system
I answered last night about that
To be continued
So yeah it was preferable to have quality jobs with iron clad contracts
I have a very close to English accent personally, even though I'm not even English
So, our talented people go to Greece to find success
Also, fun fact: In the Republic of Cyprus, Turkish is an official language, but in the south, only 2000 people speak it
Yes but that’s not always the case
Maybe I can try it one day:)
First time I saw it, I could not believe it was not a parody
But there's a few who want further integration with the Ultimate goal being that of the United States of Europe
For my country, I'd say less than 1%, because of how religious literally everyone is
Same old pattern ..
There's a lot of academic literature on attitudes and I can't do it justice here, but I would cautiously say that school-aged people tend to see themselves as the problem when they therefore perform poorly on language-related tests

It seems most "Catholic" countries have an agreement with the Vatican to teach their kids the religion
Okay ty

BAD
(But we have other words too)
I praise it brcause it gave the country hope in so many occasions, such as: WW1, WW2, Balkan Wars, Cypriot war if independence, overthrowing the Junta in 1974 etc
Obviously US politics are so far to the right that even Germany's Christian Democratic Union would be described as left wing by US commentators
Same as Cyprus
Not this year, COVID makes it extremely hard to pull it off
So, the major political powers of GC already made the consession of negotiating for a BFF solution that's just the start of the problems
I will instead focus on the most important part
We should give them Emphasis on native languages
It was changed recently
If he is that good he can support someone else he believes in and help him govern)
(Greece has more because GCs were more)*
Nicosia had three police checkpoints that allowed movement between the two halves and could sort-of feel like it's not totally disconnected
I was the only male in my class that didn't bet
My sources may be flawed**********
Also I guess the questions about Cyprus might have political dimensions as well
Although it might not fit in with the [457 year old Venetian Walls] as the mayor said (from his eyesore of a city hall), “it’s a breath of European air”
Case in point, a few years ago when I still lived in Cyprus and I was waiting for the bus, I started talking with an old man I just met and by the end of than conversation he was offering me a job I didn't even need since I was already employed
Ανδρέας should be pronounced /an

But of course, culturally there's extreme pressure in getting baptised
in some cases it could
I think the most important part of my text is to show you what each side supports in each one of these sections
I don't know if I'm entirely truthful, but some studies have it different, I guess the study I saw was the men, i shluld have mentioned that, but it'd be estimated to about over 40% for adults
It's *sfirí* in the standard language, which sounds like a sexual innuendo
Man made, not with order:
I just searched a bit
It’s not odd, but people don’t really care about it
> but what do you expect in a country of 600k people
It would take us about 1,5 hours
Ok facist
Cultural inertia in other words
It's a meme from a gameshow, where the guy was asked who's the main character of Mission imPOSSIBLE

Cyprus is not in Europe as well geographically, modern Turkish people are Anatolian genetically just their identity is "Turkish"
If you want to keep up you either need to study a lot or go to private after-school lessons
They make no god-damn sense
I hope you didn't learn it by experience :p
That's so true
Pros:
Haha we are the same
I don't know man, I love Linux too but I don't know how having sex with it would make things better
I’m going to piggyback off that and say the both sides of Cyprus as well
That's not how emigration works for most if not all emigrants
Its actually Armenian but Turks eat it too
It is quite popular with Brits, Russian, Israelis and Germans
(They alsp accept that formula)
For example, some of my releatives were massacred in their village (Tochni) in an event known as [the Tochni Massacre]
Yeah xD
Now it's just full of smugglers, crime, and people trying to escape their region or vie for independence
I would probably be worried about reopening if I lived elsewhere
2) Yes
When I was working in Nicosia, I lived 15 minutes away from my job by bike
They get him inside the pond

"Pee and drink"
If so why
They banned the play from performing and a few days later, THOC kicked us out of the partnership which my mother herself tried so hard to bring to the village
Every house has at least 2 cars(each person has his own)
The Greek ampersand is only used in handwriting, since Microsoft decided not to include it in its Greek keyboard (similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)
Same in Greek Universities
It’s highlighting the fact that we’re ignoring and/or grossly underestimating the impact of pollution and climate change
Both sides knew how *democracy* works way before the election/referendum date
No, I am not concerned that this will happen
* There isn't a "Greek side and a Turkish side". There's the Republic of Cyprus, recognised by the EU and UN as the legitimate government of the whole island, and there's an illegally occupied side by Turkey
The main factor with Greek is that from the beginning of the Hellenistic period up until ~1980s, it always used some sort of artificially ancient-sounding and purified from loanwords version of the language as the written standard
In Cyprus we say "nta" as a shortening of "entáxei" but OK is also widely used
That was rarely controversial, but the 2008 reforms were fiercely opposed because they did the unthinkable and clearly stated that the dialect is *useful* as a teaching tool
It is quite popular with Brits, Russian, Israelis and Germans
If the ambassador flies the Apartheid flag, their home country did something very wrong when appointing them
It may be changing due to American films though
I grew up in the EU and I just have this feeling of togetherness
People in Berlin seem to generally ride so-called sportsbikes, either rigid mountainbikes or roadbikes
The 25th, typically with a big family gathering at noon, and parties in the evening
I think millions of statues and flags with his face would dissagree as well
After and deal was arranged with UK, Turkish teachers arrived to teach locals proper Turkish and replaced the village names with Turkish names, for example morphou became guzelyurt
Used to, in Cyprus and Finland, but not in the Netherlands or Germany
Halloumi will most likely change in the next years for people outside of Cyprus
If he is that good he can support someone else he believes in and help him govern)

I wrote some code in the context of research, and I slapped a copyleft license on it and my supervisors never challenged it
In Cyprus for example the official limit is 100 but you don't get a ticket if you go up to +20% -1 so you can drive up to 119
are you going to say something in english
There's a traditional song we learn as a children which is gory as hell
&#x200B;
No, it's a more controversial flag than the Enosis flag, up there with the Confederacy flag in the US
I hope you didn't learn it by experience :p
Plus I am a Turkish Cypriot :p
But to make it more general, it's things like people standing a meter away from you in queues as if you smell bad or something, or when you mention some difficulty you are facing they just acknowledge your problem but make no offers to help because you are not family or a close friend
Lol no
In these countries they prefer strong employment protections, job security and high investment in the workforce
EDIT: ["no dialects, we just use the language differently in different regions"]
Between institutionalised bullying and loss of career opportunities and time-restricted scholarships, hardly anything to reminisce about while serving in the Greek Cypriot National Guard
I still wonder how that’s connected to modern English or even Shakespearian English
There is a small sun in the center of Earth and there are people living inside
There are variants of Greek in Greece though that are completely incomprehensible to me
&#x200B;
Not even China is socialist (even if for some reason the claim they are)
For us its very hard to even recognise the difference between 2 similar vowels let alone try to pronounce them
(Greek soap operas are not much better either anyway)
It's safe, so long as the house pipes are well maintained
Both Asia and Europe are way too big to be a meaningful identification
I’d say either Greece or Turkey
It is a bit claustrophobic and air connections aren't seamless
Another example is how the UK was considered the sick man of Europe in the 70s. After it joined the union, its economy was one of the fastest growing ones in the world
We have those 2 things as well ( thanks to the British Empire)
I'm curious, what are some examples of that
Yeah the topography is quite different than what I'm used to
The only exception might be modern Greek teachers but that still depends on the teacher
Okay, I sort of get it now
However, the gossip TV shows that are displayed in the afternoon are full with Greek celebrities stories
One side was smarter & knew how to get more votes
That many asterisks are needed because people may give varied answers or studies may not be complete
The paid leaves, the sick leaves, the protections

A big portion of the teachers are those who couldn't become philologists ( Greek/History/Ancient Greek/Latin Teachers ) and not religious fanatics
Oh that's a shame for Cypriot Turkish
But no idea we had an ESA
Every single little village has an accent
Close-knit workplaces would also appreciate it if you brought some zivania]
No party has an absolute majority, but the two largest parties have more or less 3/5 of the seats between them
Yeah i'm gonna have to totally disagree with the Cyprus part :P Most people get between 800-1000
Ugly, concrete structure, with jutting out lights (making it easy to trip), peeling benches, random holes (easy for accidents), and not aesthetic, ruining the area, where the Venetian walls stand, covering the walls and making the moat look 1000 times uglier
The only Pan-european party
> There's definitely a reason why paypal and Venmo are that popular
Of course, after turning 15, pollution and climate change stop being a problem
Do you think this is possible
Obligatory: It's not free, it's paid by taxes and/or an insurance mandate (in the case of Cyprus, a specific healthcare tax on each source of your income - all can use the system, only those with income contribute)
I guess you don't feel claustrophobic due to the population density because the land doesn't stop at the borders
It is seen as a wild spot with an amazing nightlife (pre Covid :( now unfortunately everything is empty in Cyprus) It also has the best beaches in Cyprus
Just write out the numbers in full digits or scientific notation
Also slow internet
We register Μιχάλης, Γιώργος, Θανάσης, etc if that's what the parents wanted
I still see them the way I saw them as a kid:D
Not much history, it happened a few years ago, bit I'm gonna say it
There's a traditional song we learn as a children which is gory as hell
Anyway what I am saying is whrn the identification is natural its okay, but not when its enforced by others other countries trying to change our identities for their own gains
Ahem
In Greek it's Τσεχία so it's pretty much the same
That goes for urban areas as well
2J beast, does some english videos too
Assuming you mean what shape for the Latin 'a' when writing by hand:
I will get the water out of the deep pond".
I love the shapes of Switzerland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and UK

[Liberty Square (Πλατεία ελευθερίας), Nicosia, Cyprus ] designed by Zaha Hadid, completed in *just* 15 years
One GC president, one TC vicepresident
It basically says that the Greeks are almighty and we finally became free from the long slavery we had
There were loud Italians (no offense) literally everywhere
I don't see any other way we can unite except by a common agreement
Yes I am not saying you are wrong but if you wanted to convince people you don't need to be that agressive in this situation since almost everyone would understand your point and thats why there is no need to be aggresive about it, being agressive would not convince people that well instead they would show agressiveness towards you ignoring your initial point
Turkey however wants to maintain presence on the island as it's location is a geopolitical advantage and TC might feel more secure .
why can't we
But you mind end up with a keyboard only listing UK English punctuation, or computers with the wrong layout set in software
That many asterisks are needed because people may give varied answers or studies may not be complete
but only with your bus company which provides you with buses only in a certain area
>I don’t like eating kebab
Well, the answer is that you can't - I asked for myself a couple of days ago
(is what I said accurate
in some cases it could
Not a single person did it
And the one who loses is the youngest one
Incoming students are advised to attend free of charge the Greek intensive courses offered during the year at the School of Modern Greek of the University
Although we share the creative industries, we have so much going on on a local level that our news are more domestic with a few news from Greece and the international scene
But it's still 100
True, especially in the recent decade, but importantly not in the systematic 'metalinguistic awareness' framework that was envisioned by the cancelled 2008 reform
Makes you feel a bit trapped when things aren't going as good
Same here in Cyprus, and it sucks
The only Pan-european party
Pirates of the Carribbean, random sailors speaking Cypriot Greek and Cypriot Turkish
Not never but least likely, France
Secular version is not very nice either I don't think that's the issue with Turkey, the issue is the extreme levels if nationalism within the country people think that everything the nation does is justified armenians, cyprus invasion, etc etc and currently stuff thats going on in Syria, imagine they went in there as operation "peace spring" and now they are waging war, on social media people are using a hastag thats promoting the war and one refugees i think in Turkey called the army "dogs" or something like that and turks found where he lived and beat him up
Some old signs in my country, Cyprus, still say miles
Turkey
I think u need a Jagellion to get that PU
But what I mentioned is complaints about the *poor* enforcement of the price cap
Living in an individualist society like Finland still feels strange to me
If you are going to come to Cyprus, do go to these destinations, because they're not bad as well, but also go on a trip to the mountains
Because of that, the first storey of a building cannot help but be the one that sits on top of the first ceiling
As I said both sides have made errors
'Cyprus' is fine
Turkey: the above\^
Fan fact about Cyprus: a guy in the invasion 1974 got shot 13 times, two times to the head before dying
It also shows that the Greek Cypriots are ready and willing for it

For mainland Greeks its even harder since the don't distinguish between s and sh , tz and j , ts and ch and also z and zh
Τον LIGHT;
It would have to be during Frankish (1192-1489) and Venetian rule (1489–1571)
ive been scrolling for ages
But what I meant is that some People wouldn't want further integration, thus preferring the EU as it is
Don't do drugs, kids
The two communities and the three guarantor powers of the Republic of Cyprus participated
Their connection with the land is less emotional
As a rising economic power and already the second biggest without even unleasing its full potential, China is looking like the next great superpower, soon passing the US, and with the rapid urbanisation, it's going to be difficult to compete without the support of the Chinese Market
Always loved ayran/kefir
Cyprus has been quite isolated from drastically different races up until the 70s. Also huge rivalries with Muslims, a sense of anti-semitism probably due to the 7 day war and stuff

We solve the problem, in Cyprus, by understanding that public holidays mean slower payments
Unfortunate yes
I guess if we are forced to categorise Cyprus, we can say it's a cross-continental country, spanning from Europe to Asia

The Cyprus problem for GC is a problem of an invasion and continued occupation of the island by Turkey, it's not an inter-communal problem and the solution to that problem is the liberation of the occupied areas
Incoming students are advised to attend free of charge the Greek intensive courses offered during the year at the School of Modern Greek of the University

Spelling exercises are common in primary school ('dictation'), but it never turned into a competition
The second invasion was widely condemned by everyone and this is the reason Turkey was later sanctioned and "TRNC" is not recognized by anyone
We definitely had a discussion along those lines in another thread
But over the years that has changed
My favourite Cypriot documentary is "Our Wall" (Το τείχος μας · Duvarımız)
Yes
Oh, well I will only answer about the free areas in the south but I am pretty sure the same applies for the northern occupied areas
No most people don't have a second name . However there are some people with 2 names e.g. Giorgos Constantinos , ( George Constantine) , that's a recent trend and I think it's when the couple  can't agree on a single name, especially when they both want to give the child their parent's name ( it's common for a person to be named after their grandparent here ) .

I went on all my life thinking that Cypriots invented tahini pie, but it turns out versions of it exist all the way to the Caucasus

Case in point, a few years ago when I still lived in Cyprus and I was waiting for the bus, I started talking with an old man I just met and by the end of than conversation he was offering me a job I didn't even need since I was already employed
It has nothing to do with what happened after the defeat of Germany
It's tragic that Cyprus is sunny 95%of the year and we have so little renewable energy
Every Cypriot has a car, universities have their own busses, but public transport is pretty terrible and almost non existent
Turkey however wants to maintain presence on the island as it's location is a geopolitical advantage and TC might feel more secure .
For one, I find Medieval Greek already removed enough from Modern Greek that I struggle to understand it (recognise words, sure - but what did they mean back then

The pop of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus has less than 1 million people
One right after the coup which was understandable and viewed positively by the international community
> Apart from that, we discourage Greek born parents from the non official variants of the names
[A certain song] was playing on the state radio when it was [taken over by army coupists in 1974] The song is still associated with the coup through cultural ambience, but it's more visceral for those who were actually alive back then

Free movement of goods ( =customs union + a quota to be agreed for primary agricultural products), services and capital are ok
also it has full control over it, so to which extent it should be considered a self declared state and not an annexation is really questionable
You should first defend the implied premise that we are only affected by the politics of a single place

Some guy was asked about the actor of the main character of the movie Mission Impossible and he didn't know english and just said "Possibol"
He made a biased observation
As a reaction to the mass-scale renaming campaign in the northern side by Turkey after 1974 (where Greek names were replaced by invented Turkish names [1]), in the 90s there was a similar state-sponsored campaign to make placenames in the south sound "more Greek". They didn't attempt to replace the names completely [2] but they still faced a lot of opposition by the locals, who loved their place names even if they sounded Turkish, Arabic, or Italian

Ancient ruins have been found underneath it during its construction as well, which has forced them to make changes in the way it was to be built, as these “ruins” -basically a bunch of rocks, had to be shown through glass on the ground
Indeed, and it's important to emphasise because in some other Orthodox-majority countries it's different: in Cyprus, baptism has no legal effect
However, I do agree that Cypriot Greek should be taught / analysed in class
Answering OP's exact question may be my day-job
It was agreed in 1977 that the solution to the cypriot problem would be achieved bi negotiations under the umbrella of the United Nations and United Cyprus would be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation
