While I do have some French on me I don’t speak a word of German (I can understand some of it because it’s sometimes similar to Dutch) so yeah I can’t communicate with every Belgian
And it just developed from there
Ussually yes, although I know someone who can't inderstand them so he talks English to them which can lead to very awkward moments
Actually that isn't completely correct as it's a mix of "het klopt als een zwerende duim

I don't know anymore, it was a very tiny street without houses in Flanders
I certainly don't deny that an accent is an integral part of a dialect, just saying that a different accent alone isn't enough to say "it's another dialect". For example, in Belgium, people in Liège, Charleroi and Namur might all have a different accent than mine, but i don't consider their accent to form another dialect
This providing a base for a European identity, on top of whatever national or regional identity you already have

Look mom, we're winning
There is some ongoing progress, however, as the government officially apologized this very year to the children and grand children of mixed union (Belgian father with Congolese mother, often mistresses) for the discrimination they've suffered from in the 1940s-50s. Slow progress, but progress nonetheless
It is not

I think the transition from unreadable to slightly understandable is around the transition from early middle ages to late, probably not entirely coincidental with the growth of cities after the 1000s.

The Finnish word, along with those of the Scandinavian languages, is actually derived from the Dutch word 'kalkoen', which is a shortened form of the older Dutch word 'Calcoetsche hoen'. 'Hoen' is an older word for bird and 'Calcoetsch' refers to the Indian city of Calicut

So because us white Europeans were the first to develop and progress as societies (on the back of exploiting numerous other countries well into the 20th century), that makes other cultures inherently inferior

Isn't the E69 the most northern highway
Why not have you own identity as Kosovans

Me personally, I would probably say “A Belgian from Flanders” if someone would ask me where I’m from :)

Not even someone calling fries "French Fries" can match the pain it causes to see someone drink a Duvel from a Chimay glass
When going to Brussels or Liège, you'll see a lot of shops selling waffles
But for most people every government does bad so it's not even that imo
I see, you've been following the Veronica Inside drama
The [old UK ones] are also cool
Niemcy a Polish colleague once explained to me basically amounts to meaning 'Not us' (an understandable sentiment, if you look in the history books)
So we have the car, the world wide web, the world map, French fries or waffles
If you don't know how to read the text as a cyclist, you can still fall back on the regular sign and find a way around like car drivers do

Until now, YouTube could just profit off of that movie until the rightholder complained

With our system at least the average shmuck throws in his vote too, even if it is begrudgingly
